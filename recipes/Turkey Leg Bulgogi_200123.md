# Turkey Leg Bulgogi

This is a new Korean take on the mock duck and Hoi-Sin sauce that has been so popular. Delicious served either in steamed bao buns. If you do not have bao buns, it’s equally delicious served with sticky rice and sesame garlic stir-fried vegetables.

## Method

1. **Cook the Turkey:**
   - Place the turkey thigh into a large deep saucepan, cover with cold water, and bring to the boil.
   - Cover with a lid and cook at a low/medium boil for 2–3 hours until the meat is falling off the bone.
   - Remove from the cooking liquid and leave until cool enough to handle.
   - Shred the meat and remove any remaining fat or gristle.

2. **Prepare the Sauce:**
   - While the turkey is cooking, make the sauce by adding the soy sauce, chilli flakes (if using), grated ginger, garlic, sugar, sesame oil, and vegetable oil to a mixing bowl; stir well.
   - Once combined, stir in the pureed pear and chilli sauce to taste.
   - If the sauce separates, let it sit for 30 minutes and give it a good stir.

3. **Combine Turkey and Sauce:**
   - Pour the sauce over the shredded turkey and mix to combine.
   - Sprinkle with the sesame seeds.

4. **Serve:**
   - If serving in bao buns, place a heaped tablespoon of turkey into a bao bun, garnish with julienned carrot and shredded spring onions, and scatter with chopped coriander.
   - Alternatively, serve with sticky rice and sesame garlic stir-fried vegetables.
