## Method

1. **Preheat Oven:**
   - Preheat the oven to 180°C.
   - Line a 12-cup muffin pan with muffin cases.

2. **Prepare Streusel Topping:**
   - In a bowl, combine 75g plain flour, 75g golden caster sugar, and ½ tsp cinnamon.
   - Rub in 40g cold butter until the mixture resembles chunky breadcrumbs.
   - Stir in 50g chopped pecans.

3. **Prepare Muffin Batter:**
   - In a large bowl, mix 250g plain flour, 100g light brown sugar, 10g baking powder, ½ tsp salt, 1 tsp cinnamon, 50g raisins, and 50g chopped pecans.
   - In a separate jug, melt 125g butter and allow to cool slightly.
   - Add 250g buttermilk (or half milk and half plain yoghurt), 1 beaten egg, 100ml maple syrup, and 1 tsp vanilla extract to the melted butter; mix well.
   - Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined; avoid overmixing to prevent tough muffins.

4. **Assemble Muffins:**
   - Spoon the batter evenly into the prepared muffin cases.
   - Sprinkle the streusel topping evenly over each muffin.

5. **Bake:**
   - Bake in the preheated oven for 16–20 minutes, until the muffins are well risen and golden, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
   - Allow the muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack.

6. **Optional Glaze:**
   - For an extra touch of luxury, mix a couple of tablespoons of icing sugar with some maple syrup and drizzle over the cooled muffins for a real maple flavour punch.
