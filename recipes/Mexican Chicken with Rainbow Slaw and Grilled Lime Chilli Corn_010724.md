## Method

1. **Marinate the Chicken:**
   - In a large non-reactive bowl, combine the zest and juice of 2 limes, smoked paprika, cumin powder, dried thyme, chili, cayenne pepper, garlic granules, and salt.
   - Add the chicken thighs to the marinade, turning to coat them well.
   - Cover the bowl and refrigerate for up to 24 hours.

2. **Cook the Chicken:**
   - If grilling, remove the chicken from the fridge 30 minutes before cooking.
   - For oven cooking, preheat the oven to 200°C and line a large baking pan with foil and baking parchment.
   - Place the chicken skin side up on the prepared pan and cook for 35–45 minutes, basting after 20 minutes, until cooked through and the juices run clear.
   - Serve garnished with sliced red chilli, chopped coriander, and spring onions, with lime wedges on the side.

3. **Prepare the Rainbow Slaw:**
   - In a large serving bowl, combine the shredded red and white cabbage, carrot, red and orange peppers, spring onions, courgette, edamame beans, and chopped coriander.
   - In a separate bowl, mix together the sweet chilli sauce, lime juice, vegetable oil, crushed garlic, and Maldon salt.
   - Pour the dressing over the vegetables and toss gently to coat.

4. **Prepare the Chargrilled Corn:**
   - Chargrill or simmer the corn rounds until cooked.
   - In a bowl, mix the softened margarine with finely sliced red chilli, chopped coriander, and lime zest.
   - Place the cooked corn in a serving dish and coat with the chilli lime butter before serving.
