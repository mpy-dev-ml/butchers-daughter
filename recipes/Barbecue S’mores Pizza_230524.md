# Barbecue S’mores Pizza

Who doesn’t adore melted marshmallow and chocolate s’mores? As good under the grill as on the BBQ — just line the rack with foil for easy clean-up. Swap in Biscoff spread or jam for chocolate and make them parev or dairy depending on the spread/choc chips.

## Method

1. **Prepare the Pizza:**
   - Spread the pizza base with as much chocolate spread as you like, leaving a 1 cm border around the edge.
   - Top with the sliced banana and then sprinkle with chocolate chips.
   - Scatter over a few handfuls of marshmallows.

2. **Cook the Pizza:**
   - Carefully slide the pizza onto the BBQ or under the grill.
   - If your BBQ does not have a lid, cover the pizza with a large roasting tin to keep in the heat and melt the marshmallows.
   - Cook for 3–5 minutes until the marshmallows are soft and gooey and the base is warmed through.

3. **Serve:**
   - Decorate your pizza with any combination of fresh fruit that you like.
   - Feel free to be creative and add sprinkles, M&Ms, crumbled biscuits, chopped nuts, whipped cream, or even ice cream.
