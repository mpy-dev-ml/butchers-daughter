## Method

1. **Prepare the Duck:**
   - Pierce the duck leg all over with a sharp knife.
   - Place it skin side down in a deep-sided frying pan over low heat until the skin is golden and most of the fat has rendered off.
   - Remove the duck and allow it to cool slightly.

2. **Roast the Duck:**
   - Preheat the oven to 200°C (180°C fan).
   - Rub the duck leg all over with the five-spice powder.
   - Place on a rack over a roasting tin in the center of the oven and roast for approximately 1 hour.

3. **Shred the Duck:**
   - Remove the duck from the oven and finely shred the meat using two forks.
   - Place the shredded duck meat in a bowl, add the chopped spring onions and a couple of tablespoons of hoisin sauce, and mix well.

4. **Prepare the Pancake Wrappers:**
   - Mix one dessert spoon of cornflour with a little water to achieve the consistency of thick double cream.
   - Smear one pancake with some of this cornflour mixture, then place another pancake on top to create a double-layered pancake.

5. **Assemble the Parcels:**
   - Place about a dessert spoonful of the duck mixture in the center of the double-layered pancake.
   - Fold two sides in to form a point and seal with the cornflour paste.
   - Gently push the duck filling into the pointed end, then fold over the remaining flap and seal with more paste.

6. **Fry the Parcels:**
   - Heat 2–3 cm of flavorless frying oil in a large, high-sided pan over medium heat.
   - Fry the duck parcels until golden brown on both sides.

7. **Prepare the Dipping Sauce:**
   - If the hoisin sauce is too thin to use as a dipping sauce, gently heat it in a small saucepan.
   - Thicken by adding a mixture of cornflour and water as needed.
   - Pour the sauce into a small dish to serve alongside the duck parcels.
