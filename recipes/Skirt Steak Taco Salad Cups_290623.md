## Method

1. **Prepare the Taco Bowls:**
   - Preheat the oven to 200°C.
   - Place a tortilla wrap inside a deep cake tin, Pyrex bowl, or fluted brioche mold (approximately 15–20cm wide) to shape it into a bowl.
   - Bake for 8–10 minutes until crisp.
   - Allow to cool in the mold.
   - These can be stored in an airtight container for up to three days.

2. **Marinate the Steak:**
   - Place the skirt steak in a ziplock bag or glass dish.
   - Add the taco seasoning, oil, and chipotle sauce.
   - Mix well to combine and leave to marinate for at least an hour, up to 24 hours, in the fridge.
   - Remove from the fridge approximately 30 minutes before cooking to bring to room temperature.

3. **Prepare the Dressing:**
   - In a blender or food processor, combine the coriander, garlic, green chili, lime juice, and non-dairy yogurt/sour cream.
   - Blitz until smooth and creamy.
   - If using a food processor, you may need to scrape down the sides a few times to achieve a smooth consistency.

4. **Cook the Steak:**
   - Heat a BBQ or frying pan over medium-high heat.
   - Oil the pan if using.
   - Cook the steak, turning once or twice, until medium-rare to medium; it should be pink in the middle to prevent drying out.
   - A little charring is fine as it adds a delicious smoky flavor.
   - Allow the steak to rest on a board for five minutes before slicing.

5. **Assemble the Salad Cups:**
   - Fill each taco bowl with shredded lettuce and your choice of salad ingredients: cucumber, avocado, sweetcorn, cherry tomatoes, and black beans.
   - Top with sliced steak.
   - Add garnishes like chopped coriander and sliced red chili.
   - Drizzle with the prepared dressing before serving.
