# Cinnamon Pecan Apple Cake

This fruit-filled cake is delicious warm. If it doesn’t disappear at once, it will keep for several days wrapped in foil, ready for unexpected guests or to double up as dessert. While it waits, the crunchy topping will become fudgy and gooey as it melts into the apples and cake underneath.

## Method

1. **Prepare the Baking Dish:**
   - Preheat your oven to 180°C.
   - Grease and line the base of a 20cm x 20cm Pyrex dish or foil tray.

2. **Prepare the Batter:**
   - In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs and 100g of caster sugar for approximately 5 minutes until the mixture is pale and thick, and the beaters leave a ribbon on the surface.
   - Gently fold in the sifted matzo meal and baking powder into the egg mixture.
   - Add the vegetable oil and mix to combine, forming the batter.

3. **Prepare the Apples and Nut Mixture:**
   - Peel, core, and quarter the apples, then slice them into 2–3 mm slices.
   - In a separate bowl, mix together the chopped pecans, chopped almonds, remaining sugar(s), cinnamon, and ground cloves (if using) until well combined.

4. **Assemble the Cake:**
   - Spread half of the batter into the prepared dish or tray.
   - Sprinkle about one-third of the nut mixture over the batter.
   - Scatter the raisins (if using) and lemon zest over the nut layer.
   - Top with a layer of overlapping apple slices.
   - Spread the remaining batter over the apple layer; the batter will be thick and may require two spatulas to coax it into the corners.
   - Add another layer of overlapping apple slices on top.
   - Sprinkle the remaining nut mixture over the top layer of apples.

5. **Bake:**
   - Place the assembled cake in the preheated oven and bake for 35–45 minutes.
   - Check the cake after 20 minutes; if the topping is browning too quickly, cover it lightly with foil or baking parchment to prevent over-browning.

6. **Serve:**
   - Once baked, allow the cake to cool slightly before serving.
   - This cake is delicious when served warm and can be stored wrapped in foil for several days.
