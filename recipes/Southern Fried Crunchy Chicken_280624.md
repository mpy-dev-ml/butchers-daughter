## Method

1. **Marinate the Chicken:**
   - In a large bowl, beat the egg and soya yoghurt together.
   - Add the chicken pieces, ensuring they are well coated.
   - Cover and marinate for approximately 30 minutes.

2. **Prepare the Coating:**
   - In a food processor, combine all the coating ingredients and process until well blended and the herbs are finely minced.
   - Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and whisk gently to combine.
   - Remove half of the coating mix and store in an airtight container for future use; it will keep for approximately 6–8 weeks.

3. **Coat the Chicken:**
   - Drain the chicken from the yoghurt mixture.
   - Toss the chicken pieces in the flour mixture, ensuring they are thoroughly coated.
   - Place the coated chicken on a baking sheet and let it rest for 20–30 minutes to allow the coating to set.

4. **Fry the Chicken:**
   - Heat a deep fat fryer to 170°C, or pour a couple of inches of oil into a deep-sided frying pan and heat over medium heat.
   - Prepare a wire rack set over a baking sheet for draining the cooked chicken.
   - Re-dip the chicken in the flour mixture, shake off any excess, and carefully place it in the hot oil.
   - Fry until golden and cooked through, turning once if using a pan.
   - Use a slotted spoon to remove the chicken and place it on the wire rack to drain.

5. **Assemble the Burgers:**
   - Split the burger buns and spread mayonnaise on each side.
   - Layer with lettuce, tomato slices, cucumber slices, and a piece of fried chicken.

6. **Serve:**
   - Serve the assembled burgers with fries, coleslaw, and pickles on the side, if desired.
