These are easier to pipe when the mixture is just made and still warm, but you can still prepare ahead by piping them onto greaseproof paper then refrigerating the piped churros until you’re ready to fry. Serve immediately. Dial the chilli up for a spicy sauce or leave it out entirely for a sweet and smokey version to suit your preference.

## Method

1. **Prepare the Chimichurri:**
   - Preheat the oven to 220°C.
   - Line a large baking sheet with baking parchment.
   - Halve the peppers lengthways, discarding the stem and seeds.
   - Cut the tomatoes in half lengthways.
   - Place the peppers and tomatoes cut side down on the baking sheet.
   - Roast until blackened and blistered.
   - Remove from the oven, allow to cool slightly, then peel off the skins.
   - In a saucepan, gently simmer the garlic cloves in olive oil until soft and golden.
   - In a blender, combine the roasted peppers, tomatoes, garlic, honey, herbs, and oil; process until medium-chopped.
   - Add chilli, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper to taste; blitz briefly to combine.

2. **Prepare the Potato Churros:**
   - In a bowl, combine the warm mashed potatoes with milk; mix until smooth.
   - Season with salt and pepper.
   - Stir in the flour and one beaten egg; mix well.
   - If the mixture is too stiff to pipe, gradually add more beaten egg until it is soft but holds its shape.
   - Heat oil in a deep fryer or deep saucepan to 175°C.
   - Fill a piping bag with the potato mixture and pipe 6 cm long strips into the hot oil, frying four or five at a time.
