## Tips for Preparing Salt Beef

1. **Selecting the Beef:**
   - Opt for pickled brisket if short on time; it eliminates the need for brining.
   - Choose a piece with some fat for optimal flavour and moisture.
   - Purchase a minimum of 1.5kg, even for two or three diners, as the meat will shrink by at least a third during cooking.

2. **Preparation Before Cooking:**
   - Remove the meat from the fridge at least an hour before cooking to allow the water to come to a boil faster.

3. **Cooking Process:**
   - Place the beef in cold water, bring to a boil, and skim off any scum.
   - Keep a bowl of cold water nearby to dip your skimming spoon; this prevents scum from sticking to the spoon or bowl.
   - Add vegetables and herbs after skimming to avoid interference during the skimming process.
   - Maintain a rolling simmer and have a filled kettle ready to top up the pan with boiling water as needed; adding cold water can drop the temperature.

4. **Determining Doneness:**
   - Begin checking for doneness after two hours.
   - Use a long-pronged carving fork or metal skewer; insert into the thickest part of the meat.
   - The meat is ready when the fork or skewer can be removed without resistance.
   - If resistance is felt, cook for an additional 20 minutes and check again.

5. **Resting the Meat:**
   - Allow the meat to rest before serving.
   - Approximately 10 to 15 minutes before serving, place the drained beef on a board and cover loosely with foil.
   - Retain the cooking liquor for reheating purposes.

6. **Carving:**
   - To prevent crumbling, carve against the grain.
   - Ask your butcher to indicate the grain direction on the packaging; consider taking a photo for reference.
   - It's easier to carve the meat when warm rather than boiling hot, and it's virtually impossible once fridge-cold.
   - If preferred, slice in advance when warm, then stack the slices closely in a dish, pour over a cupful of cooking liquor, cover tightly with foil, and heat for 20 minutes at around 170°C.

7. **Storing Leftovers:**
   - Portion the meat and wrap in greaseproof paper, parchment paper, or cling film, then wrap tightly in foil.
   - Freeze the cooking liquor separately in plastic containers for reheating.
   - The meat will keep for three days in the fridge and six weeks in the freezer.
