## Method

1. **Prepare the Crepe Batter:**
   - In a large jug, mix the potato flour with a little water to form a smooth, thick paste.
   - Add the beaten eggs and salt; whisk into the potato flour mixture.
   - Gradually add the remaining water until the batter reaches the consistency of pouring cream.

2. **Cook the Crepes:**
   - Lightly oil the base of a non-stick crepe pan and place over medium heat.
   - Pour in a thin layer of batter, then pour any excess back into the jug to achieve very thin crepes.
   - Cook for approximately 30–45 seconds, until the top is dry.
   - Turn the crepe onto a piece of baking parchment.
   - Taste the first crepe and adjust the salt if needed.
   - Repeat until all the batter is used, separating the crepes with baking parchment.

3. **Prepare the Filling:**
   - In a pan, heat the oil over medium heat.
   - Sauté the onion, celery, carrot, and thyme until soft.
   - Add the garlic; cook for an additional minute or two.
   - Add the minced beef; break up lumps and sauté until browned.
   - If using, add the red wine and beef stock; simmer to reduce.
   - Season with salt and black pepper as needed.
   - Stir in the chopped parsley and a few tablespoons of marinara sauce.
   - Allow the mixture to cool.

4. **Assemble the Cannelloni:**
   - Place approximately one tablespoon of the filling about 3 cm from the bottom edge of a crepe.
   - Fold the bottom up, then fold in the two sides, and roll up to form a neat cylinder.
   - Place the rolled crepe seam-side down in an ovenproof dish.
   - Repeat with the remaining crepes and filling.

5. **Bake:**
   - Preheat the oven to 180°C.
   - Top the assembled crepes with the remaining marinara sauce.
   - Heat in the oven for approximately 25–30 minutes, until piping hot.

6. **Vegetarian Option:**
   - For a vegetarian version, fill the crepes with well-drained ratatouille.
   - Top with marinara sauce and grated cheese before baking.
