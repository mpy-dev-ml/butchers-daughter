## Method

1. **Prepare the Sauce:**
   - In a large jug, blend the potato flour with a splash of orange juice to form a smooth mixture.
   - Add the remaining orange juice, lemon juice, maple syrup or honey, crushed garlic, tarragon branches (if using), and chicken stock. Stir well to combine.

2. **Cook the Broccoli:**
   - Bring a pan of water to a boil.
   - Add the tenderstem broccoli and cook until al dente, about 4 minutes.
   - Drain well and set aside.

3. **Sear the Salmon:**
   - Heat the cooking oil in a large, deep frying pan over medium heat.
   - Season the salmon with salt and freshly milled black pepper.
   - Place the salmon in the pan, skin side up, and sear the flesh for about 2–3 minutes until lightly browned.

4. **Add the Sauce and Simmer:**
   - Carefully turn the salmon over so the skin side is down.
   - Pour the prepared sauce mixture into the pan around the salmon.
   - Reduce the heat to a simmer.
   - Stir the sauce gently around the salmon and baste the fish with the sauce.
   - Continue cooking until the salmon is cooked through, about 20 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillet.
   - Add the orange slices to the pan during the last 1–2 minutes of cooking.

5. **Serve:**
   - Transfer the salmon to a warmed serving platter or individual plates.
   - Garnish with the cooked orange slices and the reserved tenderstem broccoli.
   - Sprinkle with chopped toasted hazelnuts or pine nuts, fresh mint leaves, and additional tarragon strands if desired.
   - Pour the remaining sauce into a jug and serve on the side.
