## Method:
1. Line a solid baking sheet with baking parchment.
2. Cut a piece of pastry large enough for the sausage meat to sit on, leaving a 2cm border along each long side. Ensure you have a second, larger piece to cover the top.
3. Spread half the mustard on the base pastry, leaving the 2cm border. Unwrap the sausage meat and place it on top of the mustard-covered pastry.
4. Spread the remaining mustard over the sausage meat.
5. Return to the fridge to defrost while you prepare the red onion relish.
6. Heat the oil in a heavy-based saucepan over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and thyme; gently sauté for 10-15 minutes until soft and golden at the edges. Stir in the shredded sage, followed by the cranberry or redcurrant jelly.
7. Allow the mixture to cool before spooning it over the sausage meat.
8. Preheat the oven to 190°C.
9. Cut a larger rectangle of pastry to fit neatly over the sausage meat.
10. Lightly brush the edges of the base pastry with water, place the top sheet over, and press to seal the edges.
11. Brush the top with beaten egg, then cut slits or a decorative pattern into the pastry.
12. Bake for 35-40 minutes until the sausage meat is cooked through and the pastry is a rich golden brown. If it browns too quickly, drape a sheet of silver foil over the top.
13. Transfer to a serving plate or board and let it sit for 5 minutes before slicing with a sharp serrated knife.
