## Ingredients

- 12–15 skinless and boneless chicken thigh fillets
- 25–30g raw lamb fat (optional)
- 2–3 tablespoons shawarma spice
- 1–2 tablespoons cornflour

**To Serve:**

- 6 pitta or laffah breads
- Hummus
- Tahina
- Chopped salad
- Zhug or harissa
- Lemon wedges

## Method

1. **Marinate the Chicken:**
   - In a large ziplock bag, combine the cornflour and shawarma spice.
   - Add the chicken thighs to the bag, seal, and massage the spice mixture into the meat.
   - Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or overnight.

2. **Prepare the Loaf Tin:**
   - Line a 2lb rigid loaf tin (or two foil tins nested together) with a paper liner or greaseproof baking paper.
   - If using, melt the lamb fat in a small saucepan and pour it into the bottom of the lined loaf tin to enhance flavor.

3. **Assemble the Shawarma:**
   - Layer the marinated chicken thighs into the prepared loaf tin.
   - Cover with foil and press down firmly to compress the layers.
   - Place a couple of tins (e.g., beans) on top to weigh down the chicken.

4. **Cook:**
   - Preheat the oven to 180°C (fan) and place a baking sheet on the middle shelf to heat.
   - Once hot, remove the weights and foil, and place the loaf tin on the baking sheet in the oven.
   - Bake uncovered for 45–50 minutes, until the chicken is thoroughly cooked and a food probe registers 72°C for at least 30 seconds.
   - For a charred effect with crispy edges, optionally grill the top for an additional 5–10 minutes.

5. **Serve:**
   - Carefully turn the tin out onto a board (note: there will be some meat juices).
   - Slice the shawarma loaf into thin slices across the width, similar to slicing a cake; some crumbling is normal.
   - Serve with warm pitta or laffah bread, accompanied by hummus, tahina, chopped salad, zhug or harissa, and lemon wedges.
