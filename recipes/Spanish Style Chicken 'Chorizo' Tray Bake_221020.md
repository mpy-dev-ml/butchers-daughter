## Method

1. **Preheat Oven:**
   - Preheat your oven to 190°C.
   - Double line your grill pan with foil.

2. **Prepare Vegetables:**
   - Peel and slice the red onions into about 8 wedges each.
   - Halve and slice the courgettes into 2cm-thick slices.
   - Chop the aubergine and bell peppers into similar-sized pieces.
   - Add all the chopped vegetables to the pan along with the halved garlic cloves and sprigs of thyme and rosemary.

3. **Season Vegetables:**
   - Drizzle the vegetables with olive oil (extra virgin is not necessary).
   - Season with Maldon salt and freshly ground black pepper.
   - Stir to coat the vegetables evenly and spread them out over the bottom of the pan.

4. **Add Additional Ingredients:**
   - Scatter over the sun-dried tomatoes, olives, chillies, and beef 'chorizo'.
   - Place the chicken pieces among the vegetables, skin side up.

5. **Season Chicken:**
   - Sprinkle the chicken pieces with salt, pepper, smoked paprika, and freshly ground chilli flakes.
   - Drizzle a little more olive oil over the top.

6. **Roast:**
   - Roast in the preheated oven for approximately 60 to 75 minutes, depending on your oven's intensity.
   - If the chicken is browning too quickly, cover with foil for the last 20 minutes.

7. **Serve:**
   - Once cooked, serve the dish scattered with chopped parsley.
   - Accompany with plain rice, couscous, or quinoa as desired.

8. **Clean Up:**
   - For easy cleaning, scrape the bones into the foil, scrunch it up, and dispose of it, leaving you with a clean grill pan.
