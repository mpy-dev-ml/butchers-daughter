## Method

1. **Prepare the Apples:**
   - Peel, core, and slice the apples.
   - Stew gently with a tablespoon of water and a little sugar to taste for around 10 minutes.
   - Put the stewed fruit into a 20cm x 30cm ovenproof dish, sprinkle with the raisins, and allow to cool.

2. **Preheat Oven:**
   - Preheat the oven to 160°C fan.

3. **Prepare the Batter:**
   - In a medium bowl, mix the egg yolks and sugar until thoroughly blended.
   - Add the melted butter or margarine, then stir in the ground almonds.
   - In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites with a pinch of salt until stiff peaks are formed.
   - Stir a third of the egg whites briskly into the almond mixture to slacken it, then fold in the remaining two-thirds gently.

4. **Assemble and Bake:**
   - Spoon the almond mixture over the cooled apples in the ovenproof dish.
   - Bake for 35–45 minutes until the top is brown and a toothpick inserted into the middle of the sponge comes out clean.

5. **Serve:**
   - Dust with a little icing sugar before serving.
