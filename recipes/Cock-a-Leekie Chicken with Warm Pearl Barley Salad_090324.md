## Method

1. **Prepare the Oven and Tray:**
   - Preheat the oven to 190°C.
   - Line a grill tray with foil and baking parchment.

2. **Prepare the Vegetables:**
   - Trim, halve, and wash the leeks; drain well, slice, and add to the tray.
   - Peel and halve the carrots and sweet potatoes; cut into 2cm chunks and add to the tray along with the sliced celery and clementines.
   - Season the vegetables with salt and pepper, mixing with your hands to combine.

3. **Add the Chicken:**
   - Place the chicken pieces skin side up on top of the vegetables.
   - Tuck the thyme sprigs and bay leaves under the chicken.

4. **Prepare the Marinade:**
   - In a jug, mix together the mustard, clementine juice, lemon juice, olive oil, and stock and/or wine.
   - Drizzle this mixture over the contents of the tray.

5. **Roast:**
   - Roast in the preheated oven for 45–60 minutes, depending on the size of the chicken pieces, until the chicken is cooked through and the skin is golden.

6. **Prepare the Pearl Barley Salad:**
   - Rinse the pearl barley in a fine sieve.
   - Bring a large pan of water to the boil; add the barley and a teaspoon of salt.
   - Reduce heat to medium and cook for 35–40 minutes until the barley is tender, checking for doneness after 30 minutes and then at five-minute intervals.
   - Drain the barley well.
   - In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the olive oil, shallot, mustard, and lemon juice; season with salt and pepper.
   - Add the drained barley and chopped herbs to the bowl; mix gently until well combined.
   - Taste and adjust seasoning as needed, adding more lemon juice or salt if desired.

7. **Serve:**
   - Serve the roasted chicken and vegetables alongside the warm pearl barley salad.
