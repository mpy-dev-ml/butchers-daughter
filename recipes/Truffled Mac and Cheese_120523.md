## Method

1. **Cook the Macaroni:**
   - Boil the macaroni in plenty of salted water until al dente, or two minutes less than stated on the package.
   - Drain and rinse with cold water to stop it sticking.

2. **Infuse the Milk:**
   - Pour the milk and bay leaves into a pan and bring to a simmer to infuse.
   - Remove from heat and set aside.

3. **Prepare the Roux:**
   - Melt the butter in a large non-stick saucepan.
   - Stir in the flour to make a thick paste, continuing to stir for 3–4 minutes.

4. **Combine Milk and Roux:**
   - Remove the bay leaves from the milk.
   - Gradually pour the milk into the flour and butter mixture, continuously stirring to keep the sauce smooth.
   - Start with a wooden spoon and then switch to a balloon whisk for best results.

5. **Add Flavourings:**
   - Add the Dijon mustard, chopped thyme, minced black truffles, and a good grind of black pepper to the sauce.

6. **Incorporate Cheeses:**
   - Stir in the grated cheddar until melted.
   - Remove the pan from heat and mix in the cooked macaroni and cubed mozzarella.

7. **Assemble the Dish:**
   - Transfer the mixture into a large ovenproof dish.
   - Top with fresh breadcrumbs and grated parmesan cheese.

8. **Bake:**
   - Preheat the oven to 200°C (Gas Mark 6).
   - Bake for 30 minutes until golden and bubbling.

9. **Finish and Serve:**
   - Remove from the oven and drizzle with a little truffle oil from the jar for added zing.
   - Serve hot, accompanied by crusty bread and a simply dressed green salad.

**Optional Enhancement:**
- If available, blitz 80g of dried porcini mushrooms into a powder and add to the sauce to further enhance the flavour.
