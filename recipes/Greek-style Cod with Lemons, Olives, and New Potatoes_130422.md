## Method

1. **Preheat Oven:**
   - Heat the oven to 200°C and line the base of a roasting tin with baking parchment.

2. **Cook Potatoes:**
   - Boil the new potatoes in salted water for 12–15 minutes, depending on size, until they can be easily pierced with a knife.

3. **Prepare Cod:**

   - Coat the cod loins on all sides with the spice mixture.

4. **Sear Cod:**
   - Heat a few tablespoons of neutral oil in a frying pan over medium heat.
   - Fry the cod for approximately one minute to achieve a golden crust, then flip and cook for an additional minute.

5. **Assemble Dish:**
   - Arrange the seared cod and quartered potatoes in the prepared roasting tin.
   - Scatter the green olives and capers over the fish and potatoes.
   - Season lightly with sea salt and black pepper, keeping in mind that the olives are salty.

6. **Add Dressing:**

   - Drizzle this mixture over the fish and potatoes.

7. **Bake:**
   - Bake in the preheated oven for 12–15 minutes, depending on the thickness of the cod fillets, until the fish is cooked through.
