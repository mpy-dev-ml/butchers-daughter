## Method

1. **Prepare the Bread:**
   - Preheat the oven to 180°C.
   - Slice the top off the loaf or rolls and hollow out the inside by removing the soft bread, leaving about 2cm of crust.
   - Brush the inside with olive oil and bake until crisp and golden.
   - Reserve the removed bread for breadcrumbs by freezing it for later use.
   - Allow the bread to cool.

2. **Prepare the Dressing:**
   - Combine all dressing ingredients in a large screw-top jar.
   - Whisk or shake to combine thoroughly.
   - Note: This dressing yields a large quantity and can be stored in the refrigerator for several months. It can be enhanced with chopped fresh herbs and also serves as a marinade for grilled meats like London Broil or flat-iron steaks.

3. **Assemble the Salad:**
   - In a large bowl, gently combine the flaked salmon, cooked French beans, lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, and black olives.
   - Add enough dressing to lightly coat the ingredients.

4. **Fill the Bread Boule:**
   - Spoon the salad mixture into the prepared bread loaf or rolls.
   - Garnish with chopped parsley if desired.

5. **Serve:**
   - Serve immediately, or wrap and refrigerate for a picnic or later use.
