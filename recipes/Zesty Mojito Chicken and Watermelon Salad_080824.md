## Method

1. **Prepare the Simple Syrup:**
   - Dissolve 100g caster sugar in 120ml water over low heat, stirring until all crystals are dissolved.
   - Allow to cool. (Excess syrup can be stored in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 4 weeks.)

2. **Prepare the Marinade and Dressing:**
   - Combine 90ml of the cooled syrup with white rum, lime juice, chopped mint leaves, and Tajin seasoning (or cayenne pepper) in a lidded container.
   - Add the neutral salad oil and shake well to combine.
   - Taste and adjust with more lime juice or salt as needed.

3. **Marinate the Chicken or Tofu:**
   - Place chicken breasts or tofu steaks in a shallow dish.
   - Pour half of the marinade/dressing over them, turning to coat thoroughly.
   - Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, up to 6 hours.
   - Remove from the fridge 30 minutes before cooking.

4. **Cook the Chicken or Tofu:**
   - Preheat oven to 200°C.
   - Spoon some marinade over the chicken and bake on the middle shelf for 25–30 minutes, until well browned and cooked through (internal temperature should reach 72°C).
   - For tofu, cook on a ridged grill pan for about 4 minutes per side.

5. **Prepare the Salad:**
   - In a bowl, combine mixed salad leaves, watermelon chunks, cucumber, red onion, and a few shredded mint leaves.
   - Add remaining dressing to taste and toss to coat.

6. **Assemble and Serve:**
   - Slice the cooked chicken or tofu thinly on the diagonal.
   - Divide the salad among four plates or bowls.
   - Top with sliced chicken or tofu.
   - Garnish with extra Tajin seasoning, shredded mint, and lime wedges.
