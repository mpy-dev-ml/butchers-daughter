# Chicken Sausage Meatballs with Sage and Fennel

This quick-to-prepare dish is bursting with flavour, and the sage notes pair well with both the chicken and the butternut squash. Why not make a giant batch of the meatballs, open-freeze them on parchment paper, and then store in a zip-lock bag or container in the freezer for fuss-free prep that will have dinner on the table in the blink of an eye.
