## Method

1. **Prepare the Potatoes and Onion:**
   - Grate the onion and potato by hand or with a food processor and place in a sieve over a bowl to catch the drips.
   - Sprinkle with salt.
   - Use the back of a spoon to squeeze as much liquid out as possible and then tip the onion and potato mixture into a clean tea towel.
   - Roll up the tea towel and twist the ends firmly to extract as much of the juice as possible over the bowl.
   - Pour away the liquid and you should find a layer of white potato starch at the bottom of the bowl.
   - Add the potato mixture back into the bowl and mix gently, season then add ¾ of the beaten egg and a tablespoon of the potato flour.
   - Mix again.
   - Allow the mixture to firm up for five minutes and check again.
   - If too wet, add some more potato flour; if too dry, add the rest of the egg.

2. **Fry the Latkes:**
   - Heat about 2cm oil in a shallow frying pan on a medium heat until shimmering.
   - Take a couple of teaspoons of mixture and shape into a small flat cake.
   - Fry until golden, check the seasoning and adjust if required.
   - Fry the remaining mixture in batches.

3. **Serve:**
   - Serve at room temperature topped with sour cream, smoked salmon, and some dill fronds or snipped chives.
