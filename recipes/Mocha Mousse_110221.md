## Method

1. **Melt the Chocolate:**
   - In a large bowl over a pan of just simmering water, melt the dark chocolate.
   - Ensure no water gets into the chocolate to prevent it from seizing.
   - Once melted, remove from heat.

2. **Add Butter and Espresso:**
   - Add the butter or margarine to the melted chocolate and allow it to melt.
   - Stir in the espresso powder and a pinch of salt; mix well.
   - Leave the mixture to cool.

3. **Incorporate Egg Yolks and Vanilla:**
   - Once the chocolate mixture has cooled, stir in the egg yolks and vanilla extract until well combined.

4. **Whisk Egg Whites:**
   - In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff but not dry.

5. **Combine Mixtures:**
   - Gently stir a third of the whisked egg whites into the chocolate mixture to lighten it.
   - Carefully fold in the remaining egg whites in two batches until fully incorporated, maintaining as much air as possible.

6. **Portion and Chill:**
   - Pour the mousse into six individual bowls or glasses, or into a larger serving bowl.
   - Refrigerate until set.

7. **Serve:**
   - Before serving, decorate with whipped cream and chocolate coffee beans, if desired.
