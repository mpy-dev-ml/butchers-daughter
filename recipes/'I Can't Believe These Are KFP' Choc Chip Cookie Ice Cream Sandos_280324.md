- 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda

## Method

1. **Prepare the Cookie Dough:**
   - In a mixing bowl, whisk together the oil, soft brown sugar, caster sugar, egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract until creamy.
   - Sift in the bicarbonate of soda, baking powder, salt, ground hazelnuts, potato flour, and almond flour.
   - Combine the mixture with a wooden spoon until well incorporated.
   - Fold in the chocolate chips or dried fruit.

2. **Shape and Chill the Dough:**
   - Divide the dough into two equal portions.
   - Place each portion on a sheet of cling film and roll into a log, ensuring any escaped chocolate chips are pressed back in.
   - Wrap the logs tightly and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
   - The dough can be refrigerated for up to 3–4 days or frozen for up to 6 weeks.

3. **Bake the Cookies:**
   - Preheat the oven to 180°C.
   - Line two baking sheets with baking parchment.
   - Slice the chilled dough into rounds the size of a large walnut, roll into balls, and place 12 on each baking sheet, flattening them slightly.
   - Bake for 8–9 minutes; the cookies will be soft when removed but will firm up upon cooling.
   - Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet before transferring to a wire rack.
   - Repeat the process with the remaining dough.

4. **Assemble the Ice Cream Sandwiches:**
   - Allow the ice cream or parev frozen dessert to soften slightly for easy scooping.
   - Place a generous scoop of ice cream on the flat side of one cookie and top with another cookie, pressing gently to spread the ice cream evenly to the edges.
   - For uniformity, use a ¼ cup measure or scoop with a diameter similar to the cookies; alternatively, neaten the edges with a knife.
   - Repeat with the remaining cookies.

5. **Freeze and Serve:**
   - Arrange the assembled ice cream sandwiches on a tray and freeze until firm.
   - Once firm, transfer to a freezer-safe container or bag for storage until ready to serve.
