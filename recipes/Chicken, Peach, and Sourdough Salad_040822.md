# Chicken, Peach, and Sourdough Salad

Sticky glazed chicken, juicy peaches, and crunchy croutons make this a summer dinner winner. This hearty salad makes the most of seasonal stone fruits. Swap in nectarines or apricots for the peaches if that’s what you have. Replace the chicken with crumbled feta or goat’s cheese for a vegetarian main. It’s best served warm, but you can make the components ahead and bring them to room temperature before adding a little extra oil and balsamic glaze to serve.
