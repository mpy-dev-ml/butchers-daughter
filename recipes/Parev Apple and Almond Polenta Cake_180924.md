## Method

1. **Preheat Oven:**
   - Preheat your oven to 160°C fan.
   - Grease and line the sides and base of a 20cm springform tin.

2. **Prepare Dry Ingredients:**
   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground almonds, polenta, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt.
   - Stir well to ensure the mixture is evenly combined.

3. **Prepare Wet Ingredients:**
   - In the bowl of a stand mixer or another large mixing bowl, weigh out the caster sugar.
   - Crack and check the eggs, then add them to the sugar.
   - Beat the mixture for approximately 4-5 minutes until it becomes very pale and thick.

4. **Incorporate Oil:**
   - With the mixer running, slowly add the light olive oil in a thin stream.
   - Continue mixing until all the oil is fully incorporated.

5. **Combine Ingredients:**
   - Add the chopped apples to the egg mixture.
   - Gently fold in the dry ingredients using a large metal spoon until just combined.

6. **Transfer to Tin:**
   - Pour the batter into the prepared springform tin.
   - Sprinkle the chopped hazelnuts evenly over the top.

7. **Bake:**
   - Place the tin in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 50 minutes to 1 hour.
   - The cake is done when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
   - If the cake begins to brown too quickly, loosely cover the top with a sheet of foil.

8. **Cool and Serve:**
   - Once baked, place the tin on a cooling rack and allow the cake to cool completely in the tin.
   - For a festive touch, drizzle with runny honey to glaze before serving (optional).
