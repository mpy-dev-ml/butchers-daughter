# Courgette, Pea, and Mint Soup with Granary Batons

This gorgeously green soup is delicious hot or chilled. It freezes well so can be made ahead to streamline your prep. Adding the peas last ensures the soup stays gorgeously bright green. Make it dairy or parev/vegan.

## Method

1. **Prepare the Soup:**
   - Peel and chop the onion and sauté in the butter, margarine, or oil until soft and translucent.
   - Add the chopped potato and stock; bring to a simmer and cook until the potatoes are tender.
   - Top, tail, and chop the courgettes; add to the pan with the mint leaves, seasoning with salt and pepper to taste.
   - Bring back to a boil and cook for 3–4 minutes.
   - Add the frozen peas and cook until tender.
   - Blend until smooth and adjust the seasoning. For an extra smooth texture, sieve the soup after blending to remove any remaining pea skins.
   - Serve hot or chill well. Top with a swirl of soya or dairy cream and a few snipped chives. Note: Chilled soup may require additional seasoning, as chilling can dull the flavour.

2. **Prepare the Granary Batons:**
   - Preheat the oven to 180°C and line a baking sheet with baking parchment.
   - Cut 2–3 slices (1.5cm thick) from the loaf; remove the crusts and cut into 2cm wide strips.
   - In a shallow dish, mix the garlic, oil, and black pepper. Quickly but gently toss the batons in the oil to coat lightly.
   - Spread the batons on the baking sheet and sprinkle with salt.
   - Bake until golden and crunchy. Cool and serve with the soup.
