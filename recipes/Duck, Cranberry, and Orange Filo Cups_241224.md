### **Prep Time**: 20 minutes  
### **Cooking Time**: 20 minutes  
### **Serves**: 12

## **Ingredients**
- 2-3 sheets filo pastry
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil, melted margarine, or oil spray
- 1 duck breast, skinned
- 1 tbsp oil
- 1 jar shop-bought or homemade cranberry sauce
- Zest of one orange
- 1 bunch chives (or other herbs – sliced mint would work or chopped parsley)

## **Method**
1. Preheat your oven to 190°C.
2. Cut the filo pastry into 5 cm squares; precision isn't necessary, and irregular shapes are fine.
3. Arrange 12 squares on a cutting board, brush or spray them with oil or melted margarine, and place another square on top, rotated 90 degrees to form a star shape; brush or spray again.
4. Press each pastry 'star' into a 24-cup mini muffin tin using the end of a rolling pin or the bottom of a narrow spice jar to create a cup shape.
5. Repeat the process to fill the tin.
6. Bake for 8-12 minutes until the cups are crisp and golden.
7. While the cups are baking, heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a frying pan and sear the duck on both sides.
8. Once the pastry cups are cooked, set them aside to cool.
9. Transfer the duck to a high-sided baking tray or roasting tin and roast for 12-15 minutes, depending on size, aiming for medium-rare with a slight pink center.
10. Allow the duck breast to cool before slicing it as thinly as possible.
11. To assemble, place a small amount of cranberry sauce in the bottom of each cup, top with a sliver of duck, garnish with orange zest, and finish with snipped chives.

These delicious morsels pair perfectly with a drink; fill them at the last possible moment to keep the pastry crisp. You can prepare the pastry cups up to 48 hours in advance and store them in an airtight container until ready to fill.
