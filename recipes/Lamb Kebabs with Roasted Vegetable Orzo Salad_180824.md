## Method

1. **Marinate the Lamb:**
   - In a large bowl, combine the marinade ingredients: olive oil, ground coriander, dried oregano, lemon zest, finely chopped garlic, and chopped parsley. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
   - Add the cubed lamb to the marinade, mixing to coat thoroughly.
   - Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight for best results.
   - Soak wooden kebab sticks in water for 30 minutes to prevent charring during cooking.

2. **Prepare the Kebabs:**
   - Halve the lemons, including the zested ones.
   - Thread the marinated lamb cubes and prepared kebab vegetables (pepper cubes and courgette slices) onto the soaked skewers.
   - Preheat a griddle pan or barbecue to medium heat.
   - Cook the kebabs for 4–5 minutes on each side, or until cooked to your preference.
   - Place the halved lemons, cut side down, on the griddle or barbecue and char for a couple of minutes.
   - Squeeze the charred lemon juice over the cooked kebabs before serving.

3. **Prepare the Orzo Salad:**
   - Preheat the oven to 200°C.
   - In a roasting tray, combine the chopped red onion, cherry tomatoes, sliced garlic, diced courgette, and diced aubergine.
   - Drizzle with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and season with salt, pepper, ground coriander, and dried oregano. Toss to coat evenly.
   - Roast the vegetables in the preheated oven for 15–20 minutes, until softened and starting to char.
   - Meanwhile, bring a medium pan of water to a boil. Stir in the parev chicken stock powder, turmeric (if using), and a generous pinch of salt.
   - Add the orzo pasta and cook until al dente according to package instructions. Drain and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process.
   - In a serving bowl, combine the cooked orzo and roasted vegetables.
   - Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and lemon juice. Add the chopped fresh herbs and black olives (if using).
   - Season with additional salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Mix gently to combine.

4. **Serve:**
   - Serve the lamb kebabs hot, accompanied by the roasted vegetable orzo salad.
