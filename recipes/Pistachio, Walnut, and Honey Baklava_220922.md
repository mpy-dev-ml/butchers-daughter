## Method

1. **Prepare the Syrup:**
   - In a large pan, combine the caster sugar and 250ml of cold water.
   - Dissolve the sugar over medium heat, then add the honey and bring to a boil.
   - Reduce the heat and simmer for 25 minutes.
   - Remove from heat, stir in the lemon juice, and allow to cool in the pan.

2. **Prepare the Baking Tray:**
   - Preheat the oven to 180°C.
   - Wet a large clean tea towel under cold water and wring out well.
   - Generously brush a 23cm x 33cm foil tray or flat baking sheet with melted butter, then line with a sheet of baking parchment.

3. **Prepare the Nut Filling:**
   - In a food processor, pulse the pistachios, walnuts, caster sugar, cinnamon, and ground cloves (if using) to a medium consistency.
   - Ensure the mixture has texture and is not too fine.
   - Start with 1 tablespoon of cinnamon and add more to taste.

4. **Assemble the Baklava:**
   - Unroll the filo pastry and cover with the damp tea towel to prevent drying out.
   - Layer the first third of the filo sheets in the prepared tray, brushing each sheet with melted butter.
   - If necessary, fold the filo to fit the tray, ensuring to brush butter between each layer.
   - Evenly scatter half of the nut mixture over the layered filo.
   - Repeat the process with the second third of the filo sheets and the remaining nut mixture.
   - Finish with the final third of the filo sheets, brushing each layer generously with melted butter.

5. **Cut and Bake:**
   - Using a sharp knife, cut the assembled baklava diagonally into a diamond pattern, ensuring to cut through to the bottom.
   - Bake in the center of the preheated oven for 35–45 minutes.
   - Check halfway through; if browning too quickly, cover loosely with foil.

6. **Add Syrup and Cool:**
   - Remove the baklava from the oven and immediately pour the cooled syrup evenly over the hot pastry.
   - Allow to cool completely in the tin.
   - Once cooled, re-cut the pieces along the previous cuts.
   - Garnish with any leftover chopped nuts and dried rose petals, if desired.
