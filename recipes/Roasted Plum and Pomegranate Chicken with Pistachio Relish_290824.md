## Method

1. **Marinate the Chicken:**
   - In a resealable plastic bag, combine the chicken thighs, sliced red onions, sumac, ground coriander, half of the crushed garlic, olive oil, salt, and pepper.
   - Seal the bag and massage to coat the chicken evenly.
   - Marinate in the refrigerator for up to 1 hour.

2. **Prepare for Roasting:**
   - Preheat the oven to 180°C.
   - Line a roasting tin with baking paper.
   - Arrange the marinated chicken thighs, skin side up, in a single layer in the prepared tin.
   - Distribute the halved plums around the chicken.

3. **Prepare the Glaze:**
   - In a small bowl, mix together the honey, pomegranate molasses, cayenne pepper (if using), ground cumin, orange zest, and the remaining half of the crushed garlic.

4. **Roast the Chicken:**
   - Spoon half of the glaze mixture over the chicken and plums.
   - Pour the orange juice around the chicken in the roasting tin.
   - Roast in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.
   - After 30 minutes, spoon the remaining glaze over the chicken.
   - Continue roasting for an additional 20-25 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and the skin is caramelized.

5. **Prepare the Pistachio Relish:**
   - While the chicken is roasting, place the pistachios and a pinch of salt in a mortar and pestle or mini food processor; crush or blitz until coarsely ground.
   - Add the chopped coriander leaves and lightly crush or pulse to combine.
   - Stir in the olive oil, lemon zest, and lemon juice.
   - Season with salt to taste.

6. **Serve:**
   - Warm the pita breads or flatbreads.
   - Serve the roasted chicken and plums on the warm bread.
   - Drizzle with the pistachio relish.
   - Garnish with pomegranate seeds if desired.
