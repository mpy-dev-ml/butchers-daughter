# Butternut Feta and Chard Borek

A delicious vegetarian centrepiece that’s perfect for a festive lunch or dinner. Perfect served slightly warm with a dressed green salad. If you can’t get chard, swap in cavolo nero or spinach. Up your flavour game by adding some red onion wedges to the butternut as it roasts.

- 2 tbsp mild olive oil
- 200g feta cheese
- 150g rainbow chard

- 2 - 3 tsp za’atar

## Method

1. **Preheat Oven:**
   - Preheat the oven to 190°C.

2. **Prepare Butternut Squash:**
   - Peel, deseed, and chop the butternut squash into 3-4cm pieces.
   - Place the squash into a bowl, drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with chilli flakes or paprika, and gently mix to coat.
   - Spread the squash on a baking tray and roast for approximately 30-40 minutes, shaking the tray halfway through, until the squash is golden and cooked through.
   - Leave to cool while you prepare the other ingredients.

3. **Prepare Filling:**
   - In the same bowl used for the squash, crumble the feta into large chunks.
   - Wash and drain the chard well; strip the leaves from the stems and shred finely. Chop the stems into small pieces.
   - Add the chard stems and leaves to the feta along with the minced garlic and a good grinding of black pepper.
   - Add the cooled squash and mix gently together.

4. **Assemble Borek:**
   - Oil a 22cm springform cake tin.
   - Increase the oven temperature to 200°C and place a heavy baking sheet towards the top of the oven.
   - Lay a piece of baking parchment on your work surface and place a sheet of filo on top with the long side towards you; brush with melted butter and place another sheet on top.
   - Brush a line of butter along the top edge of the pastry, then place a 'sausage' of filling 3cm up from the bottom edge along the length of the pastry and tightly roll it up.
   - Coil the pastry sausage around tightly and place in the centre of the tin.
   - Repeat the buttering, filling, and rolling twice more, adding each rolled pastry sausage to the coil in the tin to continue the spiral.
   - If there is a gap at the end, scrunch up the last sheet of filo and wedge it in to maintain the coiled shape.

5. **Bake:**
   - Brush the top with the beaten egg and sprinkle generously with za’atar.
   - Place the tin on the preheated baking sheet in the oven and bake for 30 minutes until the borek is crisp and well browned.
   - Leave to cool in the tin for 5–10 minutes before serving.
