## Method

1. **Prepare the Cake:**
   - Preheat the oven according to the cake mix instructions.
   - Grease and line a 22cm x 33cm (9” x 13”) baking tin.
   - Prepare the cake mix as per the packet instructions, adding an extra teaspoon of vanilla or lemon extract.
   - Bake according to the pack instructions and allow to cool.

2. **Make the Simple Syrup:**
   - In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine 100g caster sugar and 120ml water.
   - Stir until it comes to a simmer and all the sugar crystals are dissolved.
   - Allow to cool.

3. **Prepare the Custard:**
   - In a saucepan, mix 35g custard powder and 45g cornflour with a little of the 570ml milk to form a smooth paste.
   - Add the remaining milk and 50g caster sugar.
   - Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the custard thickens.
   - Pour the custard into a bowl, cover the surface with cling film to prevent a skin from forming, and allow to cool.

4. **Whip the Cream:**
   - Whip 300ml double cream until stiff but not dry.

5. **Assemble the Trifle Slice:**
   - Place a sheet of baking parchment on your work surface and evenly sprinkle caster sugar over it.
   - Turn the cooled cake onto the sugared parchment and cut it in half horizontally.
   - Place one layer of cake onto a serving platter or board and sprinkle with a tablespoon of simple syrup to moisten.
   - Spoon a layer of custard along the middle third of the cake.
   - Pipe a border of whipped cream down each side of the custard.
   - Top the custard with mixed berries, reserving the best berries for the top.
   - Gently place the second layer of sponge on top.
   - Insert toothpicks along both sides of the middle of the sponge where the custard is to help keep it stable.
   - Sprinkle another tablespoon of simple syrup over the top sponge layer.
   - Repeat the custard and cream layers as before, using a lighter layer of custard to maintain stability.
   - Garnish with the reserved berries and mint leaves.
   - Dust with icing sugar through a sieve just before serving.
