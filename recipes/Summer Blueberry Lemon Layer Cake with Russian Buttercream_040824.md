## Method

1. **Prepare the Oven and Tins:**
   - Preheat the oven to 170°C.
   - Grease and line the bases of your baking tins with baking parchment. If you don’t have 15cm (6-inch) baking tins, you can use two 20cm (8-inch) deep sandwich tins instead; the cake will be less tall but just as delicious.

2. **Prepare the Wet Ingredients:**
   - Divide the buttermilk equally into two bowls.
   - In one bowl, add the vegetable oil.
   - In the other bowl, add the eggs, lemon zest, lemon juice, and lemon extract (if using). Whisk lightly to break up the eggs.

3. **Prepare the Dry Ingredients:**
   - In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the sponge flour, caster sugar, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, and salt.
   - Add the softened butter in small chunks, piece by piece, until the mixture resembles coarse sand.

4. **Combine Ingredients:**
   - Pour the buttermilk and oil mixture into the dry ingredients and beat on medium speed for two minutes.
   - Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the egg mixture in thirds, ensuring each addition is fully incorporated before adding the next.

5. **Add Blueberries:**
   - Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake tins.
   - If using fresh blueberries, wash and dust them with a tablespoon or two of plain flour, then scatter evenly over the top of the batter. Do not mix them in, as this can cause them to sink.
   - If using frozen blueberries, skip the flour and place them directly on top of the batter.

6. **Bake:**
   - Bake in the center of the preheated oven for 30–40 minutes, or until well risen and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
   - Allow the cakes to cool in the tins on a rack until warm, then turn out onto the rack to cool completely.

7. **Prepare the Russian Buttercream:**
   - In a stand mixer, beat the softened butter on high speed for at least eight minutes until extremely light and fluffy, scraping down the sides regularly to avoid yellow streaks.
   - Gradually add the sweetened condensed milk, continuing to beat and scraping down the bowl to ensure full incorporation.
   - Add the salt and lemon or vanilla extract; beat to combine.
   - If the mixture appears to split, refrigerate for 5–10 minutes, then beat again on high speed.

8. **Assemble the Cake:**
   - Place one cake layer on a serving plate and spread a third of the buttercream over it.
   - Top with the second cake layer and use the remaining buttercream to frost the top and sides of the cake. For a "naked cake" look, apply the buttercream between the layers and a thin layer on the outside, allowing the cake layers to show through.

9. **Decorate:**
   - Garnish the cake with fresh blueberries and lemon slices as desired.
