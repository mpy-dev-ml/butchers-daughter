## Method

1. **Prepare the Spice Mix:**
   - Coarsely grind together the coriander, cumin, and fennel seeds along with the chilli flakes in a pestle and mortar or spice mill.
   - Crumble in the saffron if using and season with salt and freshly milled black pepper.

2. **Marinate the Lamb:**
   - Lay the lamb pieces in a single layer on baking paper in a shallow dish.
   - Sprinkle half the spice mix over the lamb, then turn the pieces over and sprinkle over the rest.
   - Cover and leave to marinate for at least 30 minutes or overnight in the refrigerator.

3. **Prepare for Cooking:**
   - Preheat the oven to 170°C (fan).
   - Dust the marinated lamb all over with cornflour and leave for a further 30 minutes.

4. **Sear the Lamb:**
   - Heat the olive oil in a large ovenproof pan with a lid over medium heat.
   - Brown the lamb on all sides until a deep brown crust forms.
   - Remove the lamb and set aside on a plate.

5. **Sauté the Vegetables:**
   - Add the red onion, carrots, leek, and garlic to the pan.
   - Cook for 1–2 minutes, allowing the vegetables to soften slightly.
   - Add the cinnamon stick and thyme sprigs.

6. **Deglaze the Pan:**
   - Pour in about one-third of the stock.
   - Use a spoon or spatula to scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pan.

7. **Add Liquids and Simmer:**
   - Pour in the remaining stock and pomegranate juice.
   - Bring the mixture to a simmer.

8. **Braise the Lamb:**
   - Return the lamb to the pan and season to taste.
   - Cover with the lid and transfer to the preheated oven.
   - Braise for about 1½ hours.
   - Check the liquid level and top up with just-boiled water or more stock to maintain about 4 cm of liquid.
   - Continue braising for a further 2–2½ hours until the meat is completely tender.

9. **Finish the Dish:**
   - Remove the meat and vegetables with a slotted spoon to a serving dish.
   - Discard the cinnamon stick and thyme sprigs.
   - Skim as much fat as possible from the sauce.
   - Pour the sauce over the meat and vegetables.
   - Garnish with fresh pomegranate seeds and mint leaves.

10. **Make-Ahead Instructions:**
    - If preparing in advance, cook for 1½ hours initially, then an additional hour.
    - Remove the meat and vegetables, cool, skim the sauce, and refrigerate.
    - Reheat the meat in the sauce for approximately 1 hour at 160°C before serving.
