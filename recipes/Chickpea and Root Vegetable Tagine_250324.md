## Method

1. **Prepare the Spice Mix:**
   - Combine all the spices in a lidded jar and shake well to mix. This will yield more than needed for this recipe; store the excess for future use.

2. **Sauté the Aromatics:**
   - In a large, heavy-based saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat.
   - Add the chopped onion and sauté until translucent.
   - Add the chopped garlic and thyme sprigs; sauté for about 30 seconds.

3. **Add Spices and Stock:**
   - Stir in 3–4 tablespoons of the prepared spice mix.
   - Pour in the vegetable stock, stirring to deglaze the pan and incorporate the spices.

4. **Add Vegetables and Chickpeas:**
   - Add the chopped vegetables, chickpeas, and tinned tomatoes to the pan.
   - Ensure the liquid level reaches the top of the vegetables; add water if necessary.

5. **Simmer the Tagine:**
   - Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.
   - Cover and cook for about an hour, or until the vegetables are tender and the sauce has thickened.

6. **Finish the Dish:**
   - Stir in honey and lemon juice to taste, adjusting the balance of sweetness and acidity as desired.
