These deliciously moreish biscuits make gorgeous Chanukah gifts, especially if you cut them in star and dreidel shapes. Leave enough time to make them as they’ll need chilling well at each step to keep them in shape. Be sure to chop the cranberries extremely well so they don’t spoil the outline of your biscuits. You can freeze them if you want to make them in advance then defrost closer to Chanukah.

## Ingredients

- 60g caster sugar
- Zest of one large orange
- 125g butter, softened at room temperature
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 180g plain flour
- 75g finely chopped dried cranberries

---

## Method

1. **Prepare the Dough:**
   - Add the caster sugar to the bowl of your stand mixer.
   - Grate the orange zest into the sugar.
   - Rub the zest into the sugar until it turns orange. *(Tip: Wearing disposable gloves can prevent staining your fingers.)*
   - Add the softened butter and vanilla extract to the sugar mixture.
   - Beat at medium speed for approximately 5 minutes until well blended, stopping once or twice to scrape down the sides of the bowl.

2. **Incorporate the Cranberries:**
   - While the mixer is running, finely chop the dried cranberries. *(Tip: Sprinkle them with a tablespoon or two of flour from your weighed amount to reduce stickiness.)*
   - The finer you chop, the more evenly they will distribute in the dough.
   - Add the flour and chopped cranberries to the butter mixture.
   - Beat on low speed until just combined. The mixture may appear slightly ragged, but it should come together when pressed.

3. **Chill the Dough:**
   - Press the dough into a disc and wrap it in cling film.
   - Place the dough and two large baking sheets lined with parchment paper into the fridge to chill for 10–15 minutes.

4. **Roll and Cut the Cookies:**
   - Roll out the chilled dough between two sheets of baking parchment to your desired thickness.
   - Cut out shapes using your chosen cookie cutters.
   - Place the cut cookies onto the chilled baking sheets.
   - Return the baking sheets to the fridge for 30 minutes to firm up the cookies.
   - Gather any leftover dough, re-chill, and repeat the rolling and cutting process.

5. **Bake the Cookies:**
   - Preheat the oven to 170°C.
   - Bake the cookies for 12–14 minutes, until the edges start to turn golden and the bottoms are no longer wet-looking.
   - Cool the cookies on the tray for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

6. **Store:**
   - Once completely cooled, store the cookies in an airtight container for up to one week.
