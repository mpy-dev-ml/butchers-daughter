## Method

1. **Prepare the Pastry:**
   - In a food processor, combine the flour, icing sugar, and a pinch of salt; pulse until mixed.
   - Add the chilled butter/margarine and orange zest; pulse until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.
   - Add the egg yolk and 1 tbsp of ice-cold water; pulse until the dough starts to clump together. If it appears dry, add up to 1 more tablespoon of water.
   - Transfer the dough to a work surface, shape into a disc, wrap in cling film, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

2. **Blind Bake the Pastry:**
   - Preheat the oven to 180°C.
   - On a floured surface, roll out the pastry to line a 23cm deep pie tin.
   - Prick the base with a fork, line with baking parchment, and fill with baking beans.
   - Blind bake for approximately 18 minutes.
   - Remove the parchment and beans; return the pastry to the oven for an additional 5 minutes to dry out the base.

3. **Prepare the Filling:**
   - Beat the room-temperature butter and caster sugar with a stand or hand mixer until light and creamy.
   - Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. If the mixture curdles, add a dessert spoon of flour to bring it back together.
   - Add the almond extract if using.
   - Fold in the ground almonds and remaining flour until combined.
   - Spread the filling into the prepared pastry case.

4. **Assemble and Bake:**
   - Arrange the rhubarb pieces over the frangipane filling, packing them closely as they will shrink during baking.
   - Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of caster sugar over the top.
   - Place the tart on a baking sheet and bake in the middle of the oven for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until set. If it browns too quickly, cover loosely with foil.

5. **Finish and Serve:**
   - Allow the tart to cool.
   - Garnish with flaked almonds and a dusting of icing sugar before serving.
