# Rosh Hashanah Chicken Waldorf Salad in Little Gem Cups

This makes a lovely light addition to a festive buffet. It's also a fantastic way to use up leftover roast chicken. If you have any leftover salad, it makes a great sandwich filling or works as a light lunch. Even better, you can make it up to 2 days in advance to get ahead — but be sure to add extra mayonnaise before serving, as the apples and chicken seem to soak it up.
