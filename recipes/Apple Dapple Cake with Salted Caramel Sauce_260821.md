## Method

1. **Prepare the Oven and Tin:**
   - Preheat the oven to 170°C.
   - Oil a 26cm (10in) bundt tin well.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients:**
   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the self-raising flour, caster sugar, soft brown sugar, bicarbonate of soda, cinnamon, ground nutmeg, ginger, and a pinch of salt.
   - Use a whisk to ensure the mixture is thoroughly blended.

3. **Add Apples and Nuts:**
   - Peel, quarter, core, and chop the apples into ½cm cubes.
   - Add the apple pieces to the flour mixture one by one, mixing to coat them.
   - Alternatively, grate the peeled and cored apples on a coarse grater.
   - Add the chopped toasted pecans or walnuts and mix well.

4. **Combine Wet Ingredients:**
   - In a jug, measure 375ml of vegetable or sunflower oil.
   - Add the eggs and vanilla extract; beat with a fork or whisk until well blended.

5. **Combine Wet and Dry Mixtures:**
   - Pour the wet ingredients into the dry mixture.
   - Use a large spoon to combine until well incorporated.

6. **Bake the Cake:**
   - Pour the batter into the prepared bundt tin.
   - Tap the tin sharply a few times to settle any air bubbles.
   - Bake for 55–70 minutes, until a skewer inserted into the cake comes out clean.
   - Check the cake after about 30 minutes; if it is browning too quickly, cover it with foil.
   - Allow the cake to cool in the tin on a wire rack.

7. **Prepare the Sauce:**
   - In a non-stick saucepan, combine the butter, soft brown sugar, double cream, and vanilla extract.
   - Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring well to blend.
   - Cook until the sauce coats the back of a wooden spoon.
   - Taste and adjust the salt, being cautious as the sauce will be extremely hot.

8. **Serve:**
   - Turn the cooled cake onto a serving plate.
   - Drizzle a little of the sauce over the cake.
   - Serve the remaining sauce in a jug alongside the cake.
