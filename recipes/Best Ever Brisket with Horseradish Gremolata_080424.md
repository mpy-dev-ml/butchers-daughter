## Method

1. **Prepare the Oven and Roasting Tin:**
   - Preheat the oven to 150°C.
   - Line a deep roasting tin with two layers of foil and place a piece of parchment paper at the bottom.

2. **Sear the Brisket:**
   - Heat the cooking oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat.
   - Season the brisket with salt and pepper.
   - Sear the brisket on all sides until it develops a rich brown color. This step enhances the flavor and appearance of the finished dish.

3. **Assemble the Roasting Tin:**
   - Place the sliced onions, carrots, celery, and halved garlic cloves at the bottom of the prepared roasting tin.
   - Add the thyme sprigs, bay leaves, and parsley stalks on top of the vegetables.
   - Position the seared brisket on top of the vegetable bed, fat side up.
   - Pour the red wine and beef stock into the tin around the brisket.

4. **Seal and Cook:**
   - Cover the roasting tin tightly with foil. If necessary, use an additional sheet to ensure a good seal.
   - Place the tin in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 4½ to 5 hours, or until the meat is tender and melting.

5. **Prepare the Gravy:**
   - Once cooked, transfer the brisket to a cutting board. You can slice and serve it immediately or allow it to cool to room temperature before slicing.
   - Strain the cooking liquid through a sieve into a saucepan, discarding the vegetables and herbs.
   - Skim off any fat that rises to the top of the liquid.
   - In a small bowl, mix the potato flour with a little water to create a smooth slurry.
   - Gradually add the slurry to the saucepan over medium heat, stirring continuously until the gravy reaches your desired thickness.

6. **Store or Reheat:**
   - For immediate serving, place the sliced meat onto a warmed serving platter and pour over the hot gravy.
   - To store for later use, re-line the roasting tin with clean foil and parchment. Return the sliced meat to the tin, pour over the gravy, and allow to cool. Once cooled, wrap tightly and refrigerate or freeze.

7. **Prepare the Gremolata:**
   - Finely chop the reserved parsley leaves and place them in a bowl.
   - Add the lemon zest, lemon juice, minced garlic, and grated fresh horseradish to taste.
   - Stir in enough extra virgin olive oil to achieve a spoonable consistency.
   - Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.

8. **Serve:**
   - Serve the hot brisket slices with the horseradish gremolata spooned over the top.
   - Offer any remaining gremolata on the side for guests to add as desired.
