## Method

1. **Prepare the Latke Mixture:**
   - Peel and grate the sweet potatoes and apples into a colander placed over a large bowl.
   - Squeeze out as much moisture as possible by pressing tennis ball-sized lumps between your palms. Discard the extracted juice and transfer the potato and apple mixture into the bowl.
   - Sift the plain flour, corn or potato flour, ginger, nutmeg, salt, baking powder, and sugar over the mixture. Mix with a fork to combine.
   - Beat the eggs and stir them into the mixture until well combined.

2. **Fry the Latkes:**
   - Heat enough oil in a large frying pan over medium heat to come halfway up the sides of the latkes.
   - Scoop a dessert spoonful of the mixture, pat it into shape, and run a finger around the edge to keep it neat. Carefully slide each spoonful into the hot oil, ensuring not to overcrowd the pan.
   - Fry for a few minutes on each side until golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on a cooling rack lined with kitchen paper to catch any excess oil.

3. **Serve:**
   - Pile the latkes onto a serving plate, dust with icing sugar, and serve with warmed apple sauce and a dish of cool sour cream spiced with a little cinnamon.
