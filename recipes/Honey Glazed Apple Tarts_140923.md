# Honey Glazed Apple Tarts

If you need a dessert in a hurry, you’ve come to the right place. These pretty tarts are more of an assembly job than actual cooking and so simple that even children can make them under supervision. Perfect if you’re short on time — and, at this time of year, who is not?

**Prep Time**: 10 minutes  
**Cooking Time**: 15–28 minutes  
**Serves**: 1 large tart or 6–8 smaller tarts

---

## Ingredients

- 1 roll frozen puff pastry, defrosted
- 4–6 small, well-shaped eating apples in differing colours
- 3 tbsp apricot jam
- 1–2 tbsp honey

---

## Method

1. **Preheat Oven:**
   - Heat oven to 200°C fan (210°C without) and place a large flat baking sheet inside.

2. **Prepare Apples:**
   - Halve the apples from stem to base and scoop out the core neatly with a teaspoon.
   - Slice the apples thinly to about the thickness of a 10p piece.

3. **Prepare Pastry:**
   - Unroll as much of the pastry as you need.
   - For one large tart, use a 20cm x 30cm piece; for individual tarts, cut into 9cm x 12cm rectangles.
   - Place the pastry on a parchment-lined baking sheet and carefully score a 1.5cm border around the edge.

4. **Assemble Tarts:**
   - Lay the apple slices in an overlapping design on top of the pastry, leaving the border clear.
   - Arrange different coloured apples in lines or on different tarts if you wish.

5. **Bake:**
   - Place the baking sheet on top of the pre-heated sheet in the oven.
   - Bake for 15–18 minutes for small tarts and 22–28 minutes for the large one, until the pastry is well risen and golden brown.

6. **Glaze:**
   - While the tarts are baking, heat the apricot jam in a small pan until liquid.
   - Glaze the tarts (including the pastry border) with the jam as soon as they come out of the oven, being careful not to disturb the apple slices.

7. **Finish:**
   - Drizzle the warm tarts with honey to taste.
