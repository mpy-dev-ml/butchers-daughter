## Method

1. **Preheat Oven:**
   - Preheat the oven to 180°C.
   - Generously grease a 2-litre baking dish.

2. **Prepare Dry Ingredients:**
   - Sift the self-raising flour into a large mixing bowl.
   - Stir in 110g of caster sugar and the orange zest.

3. **Combine Wet Ingredients:**
   - In a large jug, measure 120ml of milk.
   - Add 2 tsp of vanilla extract, 3 large eggs, and 50g of melted butter.
   - Whisk with a fork to combine thoroughly.

4. **Mix Batter:**
   - Pour the wet mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients.
   - Stir until just combined.
   - Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish.

5. **Add Topping:**
   - Using a tea strainer, sprinkle 10g of cornflour evenly over the batter.

6. **Prepare Sauce:**
   - Strain the freshly squeezed orange juice to remove any pulp.
   - Measure 375ml of the strained orange juice into a jug.
   - Add 100g of caster sugar and 125ml of boiling water.
   - Stir until the sugar dissolves.

7. **Pour Sauce Over Batter:**
   - Gently pour the orange juice mixture over the back of a large spoon onto the batter.
   - This technique helps to distribute the liquid evenly without disturbing the batter.

8. **Bake:**
   - Place the baking dish on a baking sheet to catch any spills.
   - Bake in the preheated oven for approximately 20 minutes, or until the pudding is golden and well risen.

9. **Serve:**
   - Dust the top with icing sugar.
   - Serve warm with cream, custard, or ice cream.
