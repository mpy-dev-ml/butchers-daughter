# Minced Lamb Hotpot

This is a crowd-pleaser that can be easily scaled up. I make a double batch of mince and freeze half for later in the holiday. You can replace the lamb with minced beef and use beef stock, red wine, and a couple of tablespoons of tomato puree instead.

## Method

1. **Preheat Oven:**
   - Preheat the oven to 180°C.

2. **Cook the Mince:**
   - Add 1–2 tablespoons of vegetable oil to a deep frying pan and heat over medium-high heat.
   - Add the lamb mince and cook, breaking it up with a metal potato masher or wooden spoon, until browned and cooked through.

3. **Add Vegetables:**
   - Add the diced onion, carrot, and celery to the pan along with the bay leaves and thyme.
   - Sauté gently over medium heat for about 10–12 minutes until the onions are soft and translucent.

4. **Deglaze and Simmer:**
   - Pour in the white wine (if using) and simmer until it evaporates.
   - Add 400 ml of chicken stock and bring the mixture back to a simmer.

5. **Thicken the Sauce:**
   - Mix the potato flour with a little of the reserved stock to create a slurry.
   - Stir the slurry into the simmering mixture to thicken the gravy.
   - Adjust the consistency by adding more potato flour mixed with stock if necessary.
   - Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.

6. **Transfer to Baking Dish:**
   - Pour the mixture into an oven-proof dish.

7. **Prepare Potatoes:**
   - Peel the potatoes and parboil in salted water for about 8 minutes.
   - Drain and allow them to cool slightly before slicing into 2–3 mm rounds.

8. **Assemble the Hotpot:**
   - Arrange the potato slices on top of the mince mixture, overlapping them.
   - Brush the top with the remaining vegetable oil.

9. **Bake:**
   - Place the dish on a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 45–55 minutes until the potatoes are golden and cooked through.
