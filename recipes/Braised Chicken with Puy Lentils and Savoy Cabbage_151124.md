## Method

1. **Preheat Oven:**
   - Preheat your oven to 180°C.

2. **Brown the Meat:**
   - Heat the vegetable oil in a large casserole pan over medium heat.
   - Season the chicken legs with salt and pepper.
   - Brown the chicken legs in the pan. If using duck legs, omit the oil and brown them slowly over low heat to render off as much fat as possible. Discard any excess fat.
   - Once browned, remove the meat from the pan and set aside.

3. **Sauté Vegetables:**
   - Add the chopped onions, celery, carrots, and thyme sprigs to the pan.
   - Lower the heat and sweat the vegetables gently for about 10-12 minutes until the onions are translucent.
   - Stir in the crushed garlic and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes.

4. **Add Lentils and Liquid:**
   - Pour in the red wine vinegar and increase the heat.
   - Once most of the vinegar has evaporated, stir in the lentils and boiling water or chicken stock.

5. **Assemble and Cook:**
   - Place the cabbage wedges on top of the lentil mixture.
   - Return the chicken or duck legs to the pan, placing them on top of the cabbage.
   - Cover the pan with its lid and place it in the preheated oven.
   - Cook for 45 minutes covered, then uncover and cook for an additional 20-25 minutes.

6. **Finish the Dish:**
   - Transfer the chicken and cabbage to a plate.
   - Stir the Dijon mustard and olive oil blend into the lentils.
   - Check and adjust the seasoning as needed.

7. **Serve:**
   - Divide the lentils among four deep plates.
   - Top each serving with a wedge of cabbage and a chicken leg.
   - Serve hot.
