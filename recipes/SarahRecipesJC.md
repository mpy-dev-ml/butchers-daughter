## Ingredients

- 150ml flavourless oil
- 215g soft brown sugar
- 100g caster sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 large egg yolk
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
- ½ tsp kosher for Passover baking powder
- ¼ tsp salt
- 85g ground hazelnuts
- 340g potato flour
- 200g almond flour/finely ground almonds
- 250g mini parev chocolate chips or equivalent weight dried fruit
- Flaky salt to sprinkle (if available)
- A large tub of Passover-approved ice cream or parev frozen dessert (e.g., vanilla)

---

## Method

1. **Prepare the Cookie Dough:**
   - In a mixing bowl, whisk together the oil, soft brown sugar, caster sugar, egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract until creamy.
   - Sift in the bicarbonate of soda, baking powder, salt, ground hazelnuts, potato flour, and almond flour.
   - Combine the mixture with a wooden spoon until well incorporated.
   - Fold in the chocolate chips or dried fruit.

2. **Shape and Chill the Dough:**
   - Divide the dough into two equal portions.
   - Place each portion on a sheet of cling film and roll into a log, ensuring any escaped chocolate chips are pressed back in.
   - Wrap the logs tightly and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
   - The dough can be refrigerated for up to 3–4 days or frozen for up to 6 weeks.

3. **Bake the Cookies:**
   - Preheat the oven to 180°C.
   - Line two baking sheets with baking parchment.
   - Slice the chilled dough into rounds the size of a large walnut, roll into balls, and place 12 on each baking sheet, flattening them slightly.
   - Bake for 8–9 minutes; the cookies will be soft when removed but will firm up upon cooling.
   - Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet before transferring to a wire rack.
   - Repeat the process with the remaining dough.

4. **Assemble the Ice Cream Sandwiches:**
   - Allow the ice cream or parev frozen dessert to soften slightly for easy scooping.
   - Place a generous scoop of ice cream on the flat side of one cookie and top with another cookie, pressing gently to spread the ice cream evenly to the edges.
   - For uniformity, use a ¼ cup measure or scoop with a diameter similar to the cookies; alternatively, neaten the edges with a knife.
   - Repeat with the remaining cookies.

5. **Freeze and Serve:**
   - Arrange the assembled ice cream sandwiches on a tray and freeze until firm.
   - Once firm, transfer to a freezer-safe container or bag for storage until ready to serve.

---

## Method

1. **Prepare the Oven and Roasting Tin:**
   - Preheat the oven to 150°C.
   - Line a deep roasting tin with two layers of foil and place a piece of parchment paper at the bottom.

2. **Sear the Brisket:**
   - Heat the cooking oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat.
   - Season the brisket with salt and pepper.
   - Sear the brisket on all sides until it develops a rich brown color. This step enhances the flavor and appearance of the finished dish.

3. **Assemble the Roasting Tin:**
   - Place the sliced onions, carrots, celery, and halved garlic cloves at the bottom of the prepared roasting tin.
   - Add the thyme sprigs, bay leaves, and parsley stalks on top of the vegetables.
   - Position the seared brisket on top of the vegetable bed, fat side up.
   - Pour the red wine and beef stock into the tin around the brisket.

4. **Seal and Cook:**
   - Cover the roasting tin tightly with foil. If necessary, use an additional sheet to ensure a good seal.
   - Place the tin in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 4½ to 5 hours, or until the meat is tender and melting.

5. **Prepare the Gravy:**
   - Once cooked, transfer the brisket to a cutting board. You can slice and serve it immediately or allow it to cool to room temperature before slicing.
   - Strain the cooking liquid through a sieve into a saucepan, discarding the vegetables and herbs.
   - Skim off any fat that rises to the top of the liquid.
   - In a small bowl, mix the potato flour with a little water to create a smooth slurry.
   - Gradually add the slurry to the saucepan over medium heat, stirring continuously until the gravy reaches your desired thickness.

6. **Store or Reheat:**
   - For immediate serving, place the sliced meat onto a warmed serving platter and pour over the hot gravy.
   - To store for later use, re-line the roasting tin with clean foil and parchment. Return the sliced meat to the tin, pour over the gravy, and allow to cool. Once cooled, wrap tightly and refrigerate or freeze.

7. **Prepare the Gremolata:**
   - Finely chop the reserved parsley leaves and place them in a bowl.
   - Add the lemon zest, lemon juice, minced garlic, and grated fresh horseradish to taste.
   - Stir in enough extra virgin olive oil to achieve a spoonable consistency.
   - Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.

8. **Serve:**
   - Serve the hot brisket slices with the horseradish gremolata spooned over the top.
   - Offer any remaining gremolata on the side for guests to add as desired.

5. **Bake the Cookies:**
   - Preheat the oven to 170°C.
   - Bake the cookies for 12–14 minutes, until the edges start to turn golden and the bottoms are no longer wet-looking.

### **Prep Time**: 20 minutes  
### **Cooking Time**: 20 minutes  
### **Serves**: 12

---

## **Ingredients**
- 2-3 sheets filo pastry
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil, melted margarine, or oil spray
- 1 duck breast, skinned
- 1 tbsp oil
- 1 jar shop-bought or homemade cranberry sauce
- Zest of one orange
- 1 bunch chives (or other herbs – sliced mint would work or chopped parsley)

---

## **Method**
1. Preheat your oven to 190°C.
2. Cut the filo pastry into 5 cm squares; precision isn't necessary, and irregular shapes are fine.
3. Arrange 12 squares on a cutting board, brush or spray them with oil or melted margarine, and place another square on top, rotated 90 degrees to form a star shape; brush or spray again.
4. Press each pastry 'star' into a 24-cup mini muffin tin using the end of a rolling pin or the bottom of a narrow spice jar to create a cup shape.
5. Repeat the process to fill the tin.
6. Bake for 8-12 minutes until the cups are crisp and golden.
7. While the cups are baking, heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a frying pan and sear the duck on both sides.
8. Once the pastry cups are cooked, set them aside to cool.
9. Transfer the duck to a high-sided baking tray or roasting tin and roast for 12-15 minutes, depending on size, aiming for medium-rare with a slight pink center.
10. Allow the duck breast to cool before slicing it as thinly as possible.
11. To assemble, place a small amount of cranberry sauce in the bottom of each cup, top with a sliver of duck, garnish with orange zest, and finish with snipped chives.

---

These delicious morsels pair perfectly with a drink; fill them at the last possible moment to keep the pastry crisp. You can prepare the pastry cups up to 48 hours in advance and store them in an airtight container until ready to fill.

This is a truly delicious combination that makes the most of seasonal cherries. Out of season you can swap in tinned fruit in juice or frozen cherries but the texture will lack that fresh cherry ‘crunch’. Another option when cherries are out of season would be a combination of dried cranberries and cranberry juice with some mandarin segments for a zingy garnish.

*Recipe by Sarah Mann-Yeager, published on December 30, 2024.*

---

## Method:
1. Line a solid baking sheet with baking parchment.
2. Cut a piece of pastry large enough for the sausage meat to sit on, leaving a 2cm border along each long side. Ensure you have a second, larger piece to cover the top.
3. Spread half the mustard on the base pastry, leaving the 2cm border. Unwrap the sausage meat and place it on top of the mustard-covered pastry.
4. Spread the remaining mustard over the sausage meat.
5. Return to the fridge to defrost while you prepare the red onion relish.
6. Heat the oil in a heavy-based saucepan over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and thyme; gently sauté for 10-15 minutes until soft and golden at the edges. Stir in the shredded sage, followed by the cranberry or redcurrant jelly.
7. Allow the mixture to cool before spooning it over the sausage meat.
8. Preheat the oven to 190°C.
9. Cut a larger rectangle of pastry to fit neatly over the sausage meat.
10. Lightly brush the edges of the base pastry with water, place the top sheet over, and press to seal the edges.
11. Brush the top with beaten egg, then cut slits or a decorative pattern into the pastry.
12. Bake for 35-40 minutes until the sausage meat is cooked through and the pastry is a rich golden brown. If it browns too quickly, drape a sheet of silver foil over the top.
13. Transfer to a serving plate or board and let it sit for 5 minutes before slicing with a sharp serrated knife.# Pear, Ginger, and Choc Chip Loaf

These are easier to pipe when the mixture is just made and still warm, but you can still prepare ahead by piping them onto greaseproof paper then refrigerating the piped churros until you’re ready to fry. Serve immediately. Dial the chilli up for a spicy sauce or leave it out entirely for a sweet and smokey version to suit your preference.

**Published on January 6, 2025**

Pretty much an assembly job - this is a fantastic way of using up Friday night dinner leftovers and is a meal in one pot. It's a great way of using up both the roast chicken remains and any spare soup, allowing you to stretch what would be a scant single portion into at least two helpings. You can use leftover vegetables if you have any or frozen vegetables, which are an economic way of buying veggies as you only use what you need. If you do not have leftover chicken, strip the meat from two small quarters of roasted chicken.

## Ingredients:
- Left-over chicken stripped from the carcass, plus any skin and wings if you have them  
- 375ml chicken soup  
- 25g margarine  
- 2g plain flour  
- 2-3 handfuls frozen mixed vegetables  
- 2-3 sprigs thyme  
- Ready rolled (dairy-free) puff pastry, thawed  
- 1 egg, beaten  

## Cooking Instructions:
1. Heat oven to 190°C.  
2. Heat the soup in a pan along with the thyme, chicken skin, and wings if you have them. They will help colour the sauce.  
3. In a separate pan, make a roux by melting the margarine and stirring the flour into it to form a smooth paste. Keep stirring for a few minutes to cook out the flour.  
4. Remove the thyme sprigs, wings, and skin from the soup, and gradually add the stock - whisking all the time to create a smooth sauce.  
5. Stir in the frozen vegetables and chicken, and ladle into individual pie dishes or a larger sharing dish. Once the mixture is completely cool, cover each pie with pastry.  
6. Brush the tops with beaten egg and make a small hole in the top to allow the steam to escape.  
7. Bake until the pastry is well risen and golden (about 20 minutes) and the filling is bubbling.

# Roasted Duck Legs with New Potatoes

A super simple but special, one-tray supper.  
*By Sarah Mann-Yeager*  
*November 21, 2024 09:00*

This quick, no-fuss duck recipe makes a perfect, special main course. Serve with crunchy green beans and a side of sweet & sour red cabbage for colour and contrasting textures. Cook one more leg than you need — it makes a super salad shredded with an Asian-inspired dressing.

---

**Prep Time**: Not specified  
**Cooking Time**: Approximately 90 minutes  
**Serves**: 4-5

---

## Ingredients

- 4-5 duck legs
- 800g new potatoes
- 1 garlic bulb
- Maldon salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- A few sprigs of thyme

---

## Method

1. **Preheat the Oven:**
   - Preheat your oven to 190°C.
   - Line a large oven tray with foil and a layer of baking parchment to prevent sticking. Choose a large tray, even if cooking only two legs, to ensure ample space.

2. **Prepare the Duck Legs:**
   - Heat a deep-sided sauté pan over low-medium heat.
   - Trim any excess fat or skin from the underside of the duck legs.
   - Place the duck legs, skin side down, in the sauté pan in two batches.
   - Cook each batch for 8-10 minutes to render the fat and crisp the skin.

3. **Prepare the Potatoes and Garlic:**
   - While the duck fat is rendering, cut the new potatoes in half and place them in the prepared oven tray.
   - Remove the outer skin from the garlic bulb and separate it into cloves. There's no need to peel the individual cloves, as they will steam and roast in their skins.

4. **Assemble the Dish:**
   - Make space among the potatoes for the duck legs.
   - Season everything with freshly ground black pepper and Maldon salt.
   - Place a sprig of thyme on each duck leg.
   - Drizzle a little of the rendered duck fat from the sauté pan over the potatoes.

5. **Roast:**
   - Roast in the preheated oven for approximately 90 minutes, or a bit longer depending on the size of the duck legs, until the meat is cooked through and the potatoes are tender.

6. **Optional - Prepare Extra Duck for Salad:**
   - If you've cooked an extra duck leg, let it cool, then shred the meat and refrigerate until needed.
   - Use the shredded duck to top a salad of Chinese leaves, carrot and cucumber ribbons, coriander leaves, and a dressing made of soy or teriyaki sauce, vegetable oil, a splash of sesame oil, sesame seeds, and a spoonful or two of mirin.

   - Place the skirt steak in a ziplock bag or glass dish.
   - Add the taco seasoning, oil, and chipotle sauce.
   - Mix well to combine and leave to marinate for at least an hour, up to 24 hours, in the fridge.
   - Remove from the fridge approximately 30 minutes before cooking to bring to room temperature.

3. **Prepare the Dressing:**
   - In a blender or food processor, combine the coriander, garlic, green chili, lime juice, and non-dairy yogurt/sour cream.
   - Blitz until smooth and creamy.
   - If using a food processor, you may need to scrape down the sides a few times to achieve a smooth consistency.

4. **Cook the Steak:**
   - Heat a BBQ or frying pan over medium-high heat.
   - Oil the pan if using.
   - Cook the steak, turning once or twice, until medium-rare to medium; it should be pink in the middle to prevent drying out.
   - A little charring is fine as it adds a delicious smoky flavor.
   - Allow the steak to rest on a board for five minutes before slicing.

5. **Assemble the Salad Cups:**
   - Fill each taco bowl with shredded lettuce and your choice of salad ingredients: cucumber, avocado, sweetcorn, cherry tomatoes, and black beans.
   - Top with sliced steak.
   - Add garnishes like chopped coriander and sliced red chili.
   - Drizzle with the prepared dressing before serving.

You’re going to love the light and lovely frosting in this summery celebration cake.  
*By Sarah Mann-Yeager*  
*August 4, 2024 09:57*

---

**Prep Time**: Not specified  
**Cooking Time**: 30–40 minutes  
**Serves**: Not specified

---

## Ingredients

**For the Cake:**

- 225ml buttermilk
- 90ml vegetable oil
- 3 large eggs
- Zest of 2 large unwaxed lemons
- 30ml fresh lemon juice
- 2 tsp lemon extract (optional)
- 340g sponge flour
- 300g caster sugar
- 2 tsp baking powder
- ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
- ½ tsp salt
- 115g unsalted butter, softened
- 150g fresh or frozen blueberries

**For the Russian Buttercream:**

- 225g unsalted butter, softened
- 200g sweetened condensed milk
- 1 tsp lemon or vanilla extract
- Pinch of salt

---

## Method

1. **Prepare the Oven and Tins:**
   - Preheat the oven to 170°C.
   - Grease and line the bases of your baking tins with baking parchment. If you don’t have 15cm (6-inch) baking tins, you can use two 20cm (8-inch) deep sandwich tins instead; the cake will be less tall but just as delicious.

2. **Prepare the Wet Ingredients:**
   - Divide the buttermilk equally into two bowls.
   - In one bowl, add the vegetable oil.
   - In the other bowl, add the eggs, lemon zest, lemon juice, and lemon extract (if using). Whisk lightly to break up the eggs.

3. **Prepare the Dry Ingredients:**
   - In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the sponge flour, caster sugar, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, and salt.
   - Add the softened butter in small chunks, piece by piece, until the mixture resembles coarse sand.

4. **Combine Ingredients:**
   - Pour the buttermilk and oil mixture into the dry ingredients and beat on medium speed for two minutes.
   - Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the egg mixture in thirds, ensuring each addition is fully incorporated before adding the next.

5. **Add Blueberries:**
   - Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake tins.
   - If using fresh blueberries, wash and dust them with a tablespoon or two of plain flour, then scatter evenly over the top of the batter. Do not mix them in, as this can cause them to sink.
   - If using frozen blueberries, skip the flour and place them directly on top of the batter.

6. **Bake:**
   - Bake in the center of the preheated oven for 30–40 minutes, or until well risen and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
   - Allow the cakes to cool in the tins on a rack until warm, then turn out onto the rack to cool completely.

7. **Prepare the Russian Buttercream:**
   - In a stand mixer, beat the softened butter on high speed for at least eight minutes until extremely light and fluffy, scraping down the sides regularly to avoid yellow streaks.
   - Gradually add the sweetened condensed milk, continuing to beat and scraping down the bowl to ensure full incorporation.
   - Add the salt and lemon or vanilla extract; beat to combine.
   - If the mixture appears to split, refrigerate for 5–10 minutes, then beat again on high speed.

8. **Assemble the Cake:**
   - Place one cake layer on a serving plate and spread a third of the buttercream over it.
   - Top with the second cake layer and use the remaining buttercream to frost the top and sides of the cake. For a "naked cake" look, apply the buttercream between the layers and a thin layer on the outside, allowing the cake layers to show through.

9. **Decorate:**
   - Garnish the cake with fresh blueberries and lemon slices as desired.

---

## Ingredients

- 12–15 skinless and boneless chicken thigh fillets
- 25–30g raw lamb fat (optional)
- 2–3 tablespoons shawarma spice
- 1–2 tablespoons cornflour

**To Serve:**

- 6 pitta or laffah breads
- Hummus
- Tahina
- Chopped salad
- Zhug or harissa
- Lemon wedges

---

## Method

1. **Marinate the Chicken:**
   - In a large ziplock bag, combine the cornflour and shawarma spice.
   - Add the chicken thighs to the bag, seal, and massage the spice mixture into the meat.
   - Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or overnight.

2. **Prepare the Loaf Tin:**
   - Line a 2lb rigid loaf tin (or two foil tins nested together) with a paper liner or greaseproof baking paper.
   - If using, melt the lamb fat in a small saucepan and pour it into the bottom of the lined loaf tin to enhance flavor.

3. **Assemble the Shawarma:**
   - Layer the marinated chicken thighs into the prepared loaf tin.
   - Cover with foil and press down firmly to compress the layers.
   - Place a couple of tins (e.g., beans) on top to weigh down the chicken.

4. **Cook:**
   - Preheat the oven to 180°C (fan) and place a baking sheet on the middle shelf to heat.
   - Once hot, remove the weights and foil, and place the loaf tin on the baking sheet in the oven.
   - Bake uncovered for 45–50 minutes, until the chicken is thoroughly cooked and a food probe registers 72°C for at least 30 seconds.
   - For a charred effect with crispy edges, optionally grill the top for an additional 5–10 minutes.

5. **Serve:**
   - Carefully turn the tin out onto a board (note: there will be some meat juices).
   - Slice the shawarma loaf into thin slices across the width, similar to slicing a cake; some crumbling is normal.
   - Serve with warm pitta or laffah bread, accompanied by hummus, tahina, chopped salad, zhug or harissa, and lemon wedges.

Enhance your salt beef preparation with these expert suggestions.

*By Sarah Mann-Yeager*  
*October 15, 2020 16:00*

---

**Prep Time**: Varies  
**Cooking Time**: Approximately 2–3 hours  
**Serves**: Varies based on beef quantity

---

## Tips for Preparing Salt Beef

1. **Selecting the Beef:**
   - Opt for pickled brisket if short on time; it eliminates the need for brining.
   - Choose a piece with some fat for optimal flavour and moisture.
   - Purchase a minimum of 1.5kg, even for two or three diners, as the meat will shrink by at least a third during cooking.

2. **Preparation Before Cooking:**
   - Remove the meat from the fridge at least an hour before cooking to allow the water to come to a boil faster.

3. **Cooking Process:**
   - Place the beef in cold water, bring to a boil, and skim off any scum.
   - Keep a bowl of cold water nearby to dip your skimming spoon; this prevents scum from sticking to the spoon or bowl.
   - Add vegetables and herbs after skimming to avoid interference during the skimming process.
   - Maintain a rolling simmer and have a filled kettle ready to top up the pan with boiling water as needed; adding cold water can drop the temperature.

4. **Determining Doneness:**
   - Begin checking for doneness after two hours.
   - Use a long-pronged carving fork or metal skewer; insert into the thickest part of the meat.
   - The meat is ready when the fork or skewer can be removed without resistance.
   - If resistance is felt, cook for an additional 20 minutes and check again.

5. **Resting the Meat:**
   - Allow the meat to rest before serving.
   - Approximately 10 to 15 minutes before serving, place the drained beef on a board and cover loosely with foil.
   - Retain the cooking liquor for reheating purposes.

6. **Carving:**
   - To prevent crumbling, carve against the grain.
   - Ask your butcher to indicate the grain direction on the packaging; consider taking a photo for reference.
   - It's easier to carve the meat when warm rather than boiling hot, and it's virtually impossible once fridge-cold.
   - If preferred, slice in advance when warm, then stack the slices closely in a dish, pour over a cupful of cooking liquor, cover tightly with foil, and heat for 20 minutes at around 170°C.

7. **Storing Leftovers:**
   - Portion the meat and wrap in greaseproof paper, parchment paper, or cling film, then wrap tightly in foil.
   - Freeze the cooking liquor separately in plastic containers for reheating.
   - The meat will keep for three days in the fridge and six weeks in the freezer.

This is a seasonal take on a basic sugar cookie recipe. If you really don’t like one particular spice, just leave it out and make up the weight with something you prefer. If you don’t have cookie cutters, roll the dough into a log and wrap in clingfilm then slice into 1/2 cm rounds when chilled.

---

**Prep Time**: Not specified  
**Cooking Time**: Approximately 14-18 minutes  
**Serves**: Makes 12-30 cookies, depending on the size of your cutters

---

   - Add the flour mixture and beat on low speed to combine. The mixture may appear dry and not hold together well.

5. **Add Liquid:**
   - Scrape the sides down and add half the cream or milk to bring the dough together, stopping when it starts to clump.
   - Add the remaining cream or milk if necessary.

6. **Chill the Dough:**
   - Squeeze the dough into a flat disc, wrap it, and chill for 20 minutes. If you don't have cutters, shape the dough into a log before chilling.

7. **Roll and Cut Dough:**
   - Roll the dough out between two sheets of parchment paper.
   - Cut out cookies using your preferred cutters.
   - Place the cookies onto the chilled baking sheet and return it to the fridge to keep the cookies cold, ensuring they maintain their shape during baking.

8. **Bake:**
