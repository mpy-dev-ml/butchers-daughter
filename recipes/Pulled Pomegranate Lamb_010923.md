## Method

1. **Marinate the Lamb:**
   - Ask your butcher to separate the knuckle of lamb from the main part, or use a sharp knife to remove it yourself.
   - Place the lamb in a large bag or lidded dish with the garlic, bay leaves, parsley, rosemary, thyme, lemon slices, black pepper, za’atar, and olive oil.
   - Allow to marinate for 12–24 hours.

2. **Prepare for Cooking:**
   - Remove the lamb from the fridge 45 minutes before cooking to bring it to room temperature.
   - Preheat your oven to 130°C.

3. **Cook the Lamb:**
   - Transfer the lamb with all its seasonings into a roasting pan or foil dish.
   - Add 250ml of water.
   - Cover tightly with foil or a lid and place in the oven for approximately 4–4½ hours.

4. **Shred the Lamb:**
   - Remove the dish from the oven and carefully scrape away the seasonings from the lamb.
   - Using two forks, shred the meat, removing any fat and sinews, and place it in an ovenproof container.
   - Add 3–4 tablespoons of the pan juices to the shredded meat.
   - At this point, you can either cool and refrigerate the lamb or proceed to the next step if serving immediately.

5. **Add Garnish and Serve:**
   - Drizzle the warm (or reheated) lamb with 2 tablespoons of pomegranate molasses.
   - Add ¾ of the chopped herbs and ¾ of the pomegranate seeds; stir through.
   - Transfer the pulled lamb to a serving dish.
   - Drizzle with the remaining pomegranate molasses and sprinkle over the rest of the herbs and pomegranate seeds.
