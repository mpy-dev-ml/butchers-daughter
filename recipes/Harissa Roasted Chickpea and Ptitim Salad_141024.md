## Method

1. **Preheat Oven:**
   - Preheat your oven to 200°C and line two baking trays with baking parchment.

2. **Prepare Vegetables:**
   - In a large bowl, combine the cubed butternut squash and/or sweet potato with the diced red onion.
   - Add smoked paprika, cumin, salt, pepper, and a couple of tablespoons of olive oil; mix well to coat.
   - Spread the vegetable mixture onto one of the prepared baking trays.

3. **Prepare Chickpeas:**
   - In the same bowl (to save on washing up), combine the drained chickpeas with harissa to taste (starting with 1 tablespoon).
   - Spread the spiced chickpeas onto the second prepared baking tray.

4. **Roast:**
   - Place both trays in the preheated oven.
   - Roast the vegetables for approximately 30-40 minutes until nicely charred and soft, stirring occasionally.
   - Roast the chickpeas for approximately 20-30 minutes until crisp, checking and stirring them from time to time.

5. **Cook Couscous:**
   - While the vegetables and chickpeas are roasting, bring a large pan of salted water to a boil.
   - Cook the Israeli couscous according to the package instructions.
   - Drain in a sieve and rinse well to prevent sticking.

6. **Combine Salad:**
   - Return the drained couscous to the large bowl used earlier.
   - Add the roasted vegetables and chickpeas to the couscous.
   - Drizzle with a good glug of olive oil and the juice of half a lemon.
   - Add the chopped coriander and mix thoroughly.

7. **Adjust Seasoning and Serve:**
   - Taste and adjust seasoning as needed; you may want to add more lemon juice or salt.
   - Transfer the salad to a serving dish.
   - Best served warm or at room temperature. If making ahead, remove from the fridge about an hour before serving to allow it to come to room temperature.
