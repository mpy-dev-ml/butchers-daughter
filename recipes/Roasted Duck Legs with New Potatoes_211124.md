## Ingredients

- 4-5 duck legs
- 800g new potatoes
- 1 garlic bulb
- Maldon salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- A few sprigs of thyme

---

## Method

1. **Preheat the Oven:**
   - Preheat your oven to 190°C.
   - Line a large oven tray with foil and a layer of baking parchment to prevent sticking. Choose a large tray, even if cooking only two legs, to ensure ample space.

2. **Prepare the Duck Legs:**
   - Heat a deep-sided sauté pan over low-medium heat.
   - Trim any excess fat or skin from the underside of the duck legs.
   - Place the duck legs, skin side down, in the sauté pan in two batches.
   - Cook each batch for 8-10 minutes to render the fat and crisp the skin.

3. **Prepare the Potatoes and Garlic:**
   - While the duck fat is rendering, cut the new potatoes in half and place them in the prepared oven tray.
   - Remove the outer skin from the garlic bulb and separate it into cloves. There's no need to peel the individual cloves, as they will steam and roast in their skins.

4. **Assemble the Dish:**
   - Make space among the potatoes for the duck legs.
   - Season everything with freshly ground black pepper and Maldon salt.
   - Place a sprig of thyme on each duck leg.
   - Drizzle a little of the rendered duck fat from the sauté pan over the potatoes.

5. **Roast:**
   - Roast in the preheated oven for approximately 90 minutes, or a bit longer depending on the size of the duck legs, until the meat is cooked through and the potatoes are tender.

6. **Optional - Prepare Extra Duck for Salad:**
   - If you've cooked an extra duck leg, let it cool, then shred the meat and refrigerate until needed.
   - Use the shredded duck to top a salad of Chinese leaves, carrot and cucumber ribbons, coriander leaves, and a dressing made of soy or teriyaki sauce, vegetable oil, a splash of sesame oil, sesame seeds, and a spoonful or two of mirin.
