## Method

1. **Prepare the Chicken:**
   - Preheat the oven to 180°C.
   - Line the bottom of a large roasting tin with non-stick baking paper.
   - Place the chicken pieces skin side up in the tin.

2. **Make the Marinade:**
   - In a bowl, whisk together the honey, orange juice, lemon juice, cooking oil, soy sauce, minced garlic, and freshly milled black pepper.
   - Pour the mixture over the chicken, ensuring all pieces are well coated.

3. **Roast the Chicken:**
   - Roast the chicken in the preheated oven for approximately 1 hour, or until well colored and cooked through.

4. **Prepare the Miso Glazed Carrots:**
   - While the chicken is roasting, heat a large deep-frying pan over medium heat and melt the margarine.
   - Add the prepared carrots and cook for 2–3 minutes, stirring to coat them in the margarine.
   - Pour in the orange juice and bring to a boil.
   - Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 5–6 minutes until the carrots begin to soften.
   - Stir in the white miso paste and honey or maple syrup to form a sauce.
   - Season lightly with salt and freshly ground pepper.
   - Increase the heat to medium and cook for an additional 3–4 minutes until the sauce forms a glaze and the carrots are tender.
   - Sprinkle with sesame seeds if desired.

5. **Serve:**
   - Arrange the roasted chicken on a warmed serving platter alongside the miso glazed carrots.
   - Garnish with chopped parsley before serving.
