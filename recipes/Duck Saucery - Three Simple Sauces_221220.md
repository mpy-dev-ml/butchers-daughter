## Orange Sauce

**Ingredients:**

- Zest and flesh of one orange
- 200ml orange juice
- 150ml chicken stock
- 2 tbsp orange marmalade
- Freshly ground black pepper and salt, to taste
- A few sprigs of thyme
- 2–3 tsp cornflour or potato flour
- A splash of brandy, Cointreau, Grand Marnier, or Sabra liqueur (optional)

**Method:**

1. **Prepare the Orange:**
   - Slice off the top and bottom of the orange.
   - Use a swivel-bladed potato peeler to remove thin strips of zest, avoiding the white pith; cut zest into fine matchsticks.
   - Stand the orange on a flat end and, using a sharp knife, slice away the remaining pith and membrane.
   - Segment the orange by cutting between the membranes.
   - Squeeze any remaining juice from the leftover membrane into a medium saucepan; discard membrane and pith.

2. **Combine Ingredients:**
   - Add the marmalade, shredded zest, orange juice, chicken stock, and thyme sprigs to the saucepan.
   - Cook over medium heat until the marmalade melts.
   - Increase heat and cook for an additional 5 minutes to soften the zest.

3. **Finish the Sauce:**
   - Remove thyme sprigs.
   - If using, add a splash of your chosen liqueur.
   - Thicken the sauce by stirring in cornflour mixed with a little water; whisk briskly to avoid lumps.
   - Season with freshly ground black pepper and salt to taste.
   - Reduce heat to a simmer and add orange segments to warm through.

4. **Serve:**
   - Spoon the sauce over cooked duck to glaze, serving any extra sauce on the side.

- Maldon salt, to taste

   - In a saucepan, combine the reserved liquid (or cherry/cranberry juice if using fresh cherries), cherry jam, star anise, cinnamon stick, and Port or kiddush wine.

2. **Finish the Sauce:**
