# Grilled Chicken Salad with Cherry Balsamic Vinaigrette

This is a truly delicious combination that makes the most of seasonal cherries. Out of season you can swap in tinned fruit in juice or frozen cherries but the texture will lack that fresh cherry ‘crunch’. Another option when cherries are out of season would be a combination of dried cranberries and cranberry juice with some mandarin segments for a zingy garnish.

## Method

1. **Preheat Grill:**
   - Preheat your grill or griddle pan to medium-high heat.

2. **Prepare and Cook Chicken:**
   - Brush the chicken with approximately two tablespoons of the balsamic glaze.
   - Grill or griddle for approximately 3–4 minutes per side until the chicken is cooked through and there is no pink meat visible.
   - Remove the chicken to a plate to cool to room temperature.

3. **Prepare Dressing:**
   - Place all the dressing ingredients, except the sugar, into a high-speed or regular blender or food processor and blitz until smooth.
   - Taste and adjust the seasoning; you may need to add the sugar if the cherries are very tart.
   - Refrigerate until ready to use.

4. **Assemble Salad:**
   - Arrange the salad leaves on a large platter or individual plates.
   - Top with the remaining salad ingredients and the cooled chicken.

5. **Dress and Garnish:**
   - Spoon a little of the dressing over the salad.
   - Garnish with pomegranate seeds, pistachios (if using), and fresh herbs.
   - Drizzle with additional balsamic glaze.

6. **Serve:**
   - Pour the remaining dressing into a bowl or jug to accompany the dish.
