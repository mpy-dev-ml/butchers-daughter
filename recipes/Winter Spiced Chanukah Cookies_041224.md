This is a seasonal take on a basic sugar cookie recipe. If you really don’t like one particular spice, just leave it out and make up the weight with something you prefer. If you don’t have cookie cutters, roll the dough into a log and wrap in clingfilm then slice into 1/2 cm rounds when chilled.

## Method

1. **Prepare the Baking Sheet:**
   - Line a baking sheet with baking parchment and place it in the fridge to cool.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients:**
   - Sift the flour, spices, and salt into a medium mixing bowl.
   - Stir with a balloon whisk to combine.

3. **Cream Butter and Sugars:**
   - In a stand mixer bowl, cream the softened butter with both sugars until light and fluffy.

4. **Combine Mixtures:**
   - Scrape down the sides of the bowl.
   - Add the flour mixture and beat on low speed to combine. The mixture may appear dry and not hold together well.

5. **Add Liquid:**
   - Scrape the sides down and add half the cream or milk to bring the dough together, stopping when it starts to clump.
   - Add the remaining cream or milk if necessary.

6. **Chill the Dough:**
   - Squeeze the dough into a flat disc, wrap it, and chill for 20 minutes. If you don't have cutters, shape the dough into a log before chilling.

7. **Roll and Cut Dough:**
   - Roll the dough out between two sheets of parchment paper.
   - Cut out cookies using your preferred cutters.
   - Place the cookies onto the chilled baking sheet and return it to the fridge to keep the cookies cold, ensuring they maintain their shape during baking.

8. **Bake:**
   - Preheat the oven to 140°C.
   - Bake the chilled cookies for approximately 14-18 minutes, or until the edges are golden and the bottoms are dry.

9. **Cool:**
   - Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes.
   - Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
