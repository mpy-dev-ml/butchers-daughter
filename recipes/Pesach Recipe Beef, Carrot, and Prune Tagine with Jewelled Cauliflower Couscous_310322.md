# Pesach Recipe: Beef, Carrot, and Prune Tagine with Jewelled Cauliflower Couscous

A Seder showstopper that will wow the crowd. This gorgeous main course is easy to prepare and will sit happily in an oven or on a hot plate until you’re ready to serve. Just add an extra cupful of beef stock or water to keep it from drying out. The cauliflower is the perfect accompaniment and is also low GI and gluten-free. Ideally, wash and dry the cauliflower the day before you want to make the couscous so it is dry.

## Method

1. **Marinate the Beef:**
   - Place the beef cubes in a plastic bag with 2–3 tablespoons of the spice mix.
   - Shake well to coat the beef and leave to marinate for a minimum of 30 minutes.

2. **Prepare the Tagine:**
   - Heat the vegetable oil in a casserole over medium heat.
   - Sauté the sliced onions until translucent.
   - Add the minced garlic and cook for a few seconds.
   - Stir in 1 tablespoon of the spice mix, coating the onions and garlic. If it sticks, add a splash of water.
   - Add the marinated beef and cook for a couple of minutes, stirring occasionally.
   - Pour in the chopped tomatoes and beef stock.
   - Add the carrot slices and season with salt and pepper.
   - Stir well, bring to a simmer, then cover with a lid and cook for about 90 minutes.

3. **Add Prunes and Finish Cooking:**
   - Remove the lid and stir in the prunes, lemon juice, and honey.
   - Continue cooking for an additional 30–45 minutes.
     - If serving immediately, cook uncovered to reduce the liquid.
     - If holding on a hot plate, cook covered and add extra stock or water to prevent drying out.
   - Adjust seasoning with additional salt, lemon juice, or honey to taste.
   - Garnish with chopped flat-leaf parsley before serving.

4. **Prepare the Cauliflower Couscous:**
   - Break the cauliflower into small florets, removing as much stalk as possible.
   - Wash and dry thoroughly.
   - Process the florets in batches until they resemble couscous grains.
   - Heat half of the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat.
   - Stir-fry half of the processed cauliflower for about 4–5 minutes.
   - Transfer to a large heatproof serving dish or foil.
   - Repeat with the remaining oil and cauliflower.

5. **Assemble the Jewelled Couscous:**
   - When ready to serve, combine the stir-fried cauliflower with dried apricots, raisins or sultanas, sliced spring onions, and toasted flaked almonds.
   - Garnish with chopped herbs and pomegranate seeds, if desired.
   - If holding on a hot plate, add the pomegranate seeds and herbs just before serving to maintain freshness.
