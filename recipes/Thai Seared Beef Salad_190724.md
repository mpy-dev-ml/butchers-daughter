## Method

1. **Prepare the Marinade and Dressing:**
   - In a screw-top jar, dissolve the brown sugar with a couple of teaspoons of boiling water.
   - Add the lime juice, crushed garlic, soy sauce, sesame oil, and grated ginger.
   - Secure the lid and shake well to combine.

2. **Marinate the Beef:**
   - Place the beef in a non-metallic dish or a ziplock bag.
   - Pour half of the marinade over the beef, ensuring it is well coated.
   - Marinate for a couple of hours, turning the meat occasionally.

3. **Sear the Beef:**
   - Heat a griddle or frying pan to its highest temperature.
   - Remove the beef from the marinade and pat dry.
   - Sear the beef for 3–4 minutes on one side until a dark crust forms. (Note: This process may produce smoke; ensure proper ventilation.)
   - Flip the beef and cook for an additional 2–3 minutes.
   - Remove from heat and allow the beef to rest on a cutting board.

4. **Assemble the Salad:**
   - In a large bowl, combine the quartered tomatoes, sliced cucumber, red onion, chopped lettuce, sliced chillies, mint, coriander, and Thai basil (if using).
   - Add a tablespoon of vegetable oil to the remaining marinade to create the dressing.
   - Pour the dressing over the salad and toss to coat evenly.

5. **Serve:**
   - Thinly slice the rested beef against the grain.
   - Arrange the beef slices atop the dressed salad.
   - Garnish with additional sliced red chillies, spring onions, and lime wedges.
