## Method

1. **Prepare the Rhubarb:**
   - Preheat the oven to 180°C.
   - Grease and line a 20cm deep-sided springform cake tin.
   - Place the trimmed rhubarb in a single layer in a heatproof dish.
   - Squeeze over the orange juice and sprinkle with the zest and 20g sugar.
   - Cover with foil and bake for 10 minutes.
   - Remove the foil and bake for an additional 5 minutes.
   - Set aside to cool.

2. **Prepare the Cake Batter:**
   - In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened butter and 250g golden caster sugar with a stand mixer or electric hand mixer for 2–3 minutes until light and fluffy.
   - In a separate bowl, combine the plain flour, ground almonds, baking powder, ground ginger, and salt.
   - Add a tablespoon of the dry mixture to the butter and sugar mixture.
   - Beat in the eggs one at a time, alternating each egg with a spoonful of the dry mixture to prevent curdling.
   - Fold in the remaining dry ingredients.
   - Stir through the Greek yoghurt until well combined.

3. **Assemble the Cake:**
   - Pour half of the batter into the prepared cake tin and spread evenly.
   - Arrange half of the roasted rhubarb over the batter.
   - Spoon the remaining batter over the rhubarb and spread carefully.
   - Arrange the remaining rhubarb on top in a decorative pattern.

4. **Bake the Cake:**
   - Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean.
   - After the first 40 minutes, cover the cake with foil to prevent over-browning.

5. **Prepare the Glaze:**
   - Pour the syrupy juices from the rhubarb baking dish into a small pan.
   - Add the ginger preserve and melt over gentle heat.

6. **Finish the Cake:**
   - Once the cake is baked, remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly.
   - Brush the ginger glaze over the top of the cake.
   - Decorate with chopped pistachios and dried rose petals, if desired.

7. **Serve:**
   - Allow the cake to cool completely before serving.
