## Method

1. **Prepare the Oven and Chicken:**
   - Preheat the oven to 200°C.
   - Line a grill pan with foil and baking parchment.
   - Place the spatchcocked chicken skin side up in the prepared pan.

2. **Prepare the Herb Butter:**
   - In a medium bowl, combine the softened margarine, lemon zest, lemon juice, minced garlic, and chopped tarragon.
   - Season with Maldon salt and freshly ground black pepper.
   - Mash together with a fork until well combined.

3. **Apply the Herb Butter:**
   - Gently lift the skin away from the chicken breast and spread about one-third of the herb butter mixture under the skin over the breast meat.
   - Smear the remaining mixture over the skin of the chicken.
   - Place the two lemon halves into the tray alongside the chicken.
   - Pour the chicken stock and white wine or kosher vermouth into the tray.

4. **Prepare the Vegetables:**
   - Line a shallow tray with baking parchment.
   - Arrange the red onion wedges and chicory quarters in a single layer on the tray.
   - Drizzle with mild olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
   - Roast the vegetables alongside the chicken.

5. **Roast the Chicken and Vegetables:**
   - Roast for 45–60 minutes, or until the chicken skin is crisp and the juices run clear when the thigh is pierced with a knife at the thickest part.
   - Ensure the vegetables are tender and slightly charred.

6. **Rest and Serve:**
   - Transfer the chicken to a serving plate and let it rest for 5 minutes.
   - Add 1–2 teaspoons of honey to the pan juices, adjusting to taste.
   - Arrange the roasted vegetables around the chicken.
   - Spoon the pan juices over the chicken and vegetables.
   - Garnish with the reserved tarragon leaves and the roasted lemon halves.
