## Method

1. **Prepare the Meatballs:**
   - Preheat the oven to 180°C and place a heavy baking sheet on the middle shelf.
   - In a large bowl, combine all meatball ingredients until well mixed.
   - Form the mixture into walnut-sized meatballs.
   - Refrigerate the meatballs for 30 minutes to firm up.

2. **Cook the Meatballs:**
   - Carefully remove the hot baking sheet from the oven and arrange the meatballs on it.
   - Return the sheet to the oven and bake for 20–25 minutes, until the meatballs are well browned and cooked through.

3. **Prepare the Sauce:**
   - While the meatballs are baking, heat 2 teaspoons of oil in a heavy-based saucepan over medium heat.
   - Add the finely grated garlic and sauté for about 30 seconds until fragrant.
   - Stir in the rice wine vinegar and soy sauce.
   - Add the beef stock or water, brown sugar, and gochujang (or sriracha and honey mixture).
   - Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer.
   - Stir in the sesame oil and allow the sauce to reduce by one-third.
   - In a small bowl, mix the cornflour with a little water to create a slurry.
   - Whisk the cornflour slurry into the sauce until well blended.
   - Continue to simmer the sauce until it has reduced by half and thickened.

4. **Combine Meatballs and Sauce:**
   - Once the meatballs are cooked, add them to the saucepan with the sauce.
   - Turn the meatballs to coat them evenly in the sauce.
   - Allow them to heat through in the sauce for about 5–8 minutes, so they absorb the flavours.

5. **Serve:**
   - Transfer the meatballs and sauce to a serving dish.
   - Garnish with sesame seeds and finely chopped spring onions.
   - Serve hot, accompanied by steamed rice.
