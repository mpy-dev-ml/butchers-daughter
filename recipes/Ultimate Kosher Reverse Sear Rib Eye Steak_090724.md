## Method

1. **Preheat Oven:**
   - Heat your oven to 135°C.

2. **Season and Prepare Steak:**
   - Season the steak with Maldon salt and freshly milled black pepper.
   - Place it on a grill rack inside a shallow roasting tin to catch the drips.

3. **Cook in Oven:**
   - Cook until the steak reaches an internal temperature of:
     - 35°C (95°F) for rare
     - 40°C (105°F) for medium rare
     - 45°C (115°F) for medium
   - This will take between 20–45 minutes, depending on the size and thickness of your steak.

4. **Rest Steak:**
   - Allow the steak to rest for 5 minutes.

5. **Preheat Griddle or Frying Pan:**
   - While the steak is resting, heat a griddle or heavy-based frying pan to the hottest temperature possible.
   - Ensure proper ventilation by shutting the kitchen door and opening windows and the back door if available.

6. **Sear Steak:**
   - Brush the steak with a little neutral vegetable oil.
   - Sear the steak for 35–45 seconds to achieve a good crust.
   - Flip it over and sear the other side for another 45 seconds.
   - Sear the edges by holding the steak with a pair of tongs.

7. **Final Rest and Serve:**
   - Move the steak to a board to rest for a few minutes.
   - Slice across the grain, parallel with the bone, and serve.
