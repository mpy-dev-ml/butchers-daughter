## Method

1. **Preheat Oven:**
   - Preheat the oven to 180°C (fan).  
   - Grease and line your baking tin(s).  

2. **Prepare Pears:**
   - Peel, core, and finely dice the pears into a small bowl.  
   - Add the juice of half a lemon and the zest to prevent the pear from turning brown.  

3. **Mix Wet Ingredients:**
   - In the bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, whisk the oil and sugar until the sugar is dissolved.  
   - Beat in the eggs one at a time and whisk until the mixture is thick and pale.  

4. **Combine Ingredients:**
   - Fold in the pear and lemon mixture, then add the chopped stem ginger and chocolate chips.  
   - Sieve the dry ingredients (flour, ground ginger, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, and salt) into the bowl and fold gently. Avoid overmixing to prevent the cake from becoming tough.  

5. **Bake:**
   - Pour the batter into the prepared tin(s).  
   - Bake for 45 to 70 minutes, depending on the size of the tins. If the cake is browning too quickly, cover it with a piece of foil.  
   - Check for doneness with a thin skewer inserted into the center; it may be moist due to the fruit, but there should be no raw batter clinging to it.  

6. **Cool and Garnish:**
   - Allow the cake to cool in the tin.  
   - Prepare a glacé icing by mixing the icing sugar with equal amounts of lemon juice, ginger syrup, and water to achieve a thick pouring consistency.  
   - Pour the icing over the cooled cake.  
   - Garnish with oven-dried pear slices (if using), chopped stem ginger, and chocolate chips.
